        Rheumatoid Arthritis
      </h1>
      <div class="post-content">
         <p>Like Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease.</p> <h3>Symptoms of RA</h3> <p>RA primarily attacks the synovial membranes that secrete the lubricating fluid in the joints. This results in joint inflammation and the destruction of connective tissue and cartilage surrounding the joints. A rather painful condition that requires great care and therapy, Rheumatoid Arthritis, can be controlled and eradicated with the help of your own will power.</p> <p>Symptoms of this kind of arthritis include joint stiffness, tenderness, and swelling, as well as fatigue, anemia, and crippling pain. Further, painful arthritic nodes develop at pressure points, such as the elbows and knees. In the final stage of the disease, the patient generally has joint defects, muscle destruction, soft tissue tumors, and bone and cartilage degeneration, as well as ankylosis.</p> <p>Medical treatment includes rest, exercise to improve joint function, drugs to reduce pain and inflammation, surgery to prevent or correct defects, and a nutritional diet. Steroids are given with caution because of their known side effects.</p> <p>In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, the tissue type most frequently found in patients is HL-DR4. The bacteria that most closely matches the characteristics of HL-DR4 is Proteus, a common cause of urinary tract infections. Interestingly enough, women, who have a much higher rate of urinary tract infections than men, also suffer from rheumatoid arthritis twice as often as men.</p> <p>There was a time when Proteus was identified as close in characteristics to HL-DR4 tissue types. When levels of Proteus antibodies found in the blood of people with rheumatoid arthritis were compared with those of healthy people, the levels were much higher in the people suffering from RA. When strong armies of beneficial bacteria are on guard to control the overgrowth of Proteus, many symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis can be eliminated.</p> <h3>Recommended Probiotic Regimen</h3> <p>In addition to the following a probiotic regimen, those with rheumatoid arthritis may consider taking 1 tablespoon of emulsified cod liver oil, which helps to minimize pain.</p> <p>In addition to the above regimen, for increased strength, take 1 combination capsule that contains all three super strains in an oil-matrix carrier, one to three times daily. But most important instruction to be borne in mind is a good and healthy diet.</p> <p>Leafy vegetables, almonds, at least 2 glasses of skimmed milk and adequate amount of stretching exercises, coupled with regular morning walks can keep RA at bay.</p>
