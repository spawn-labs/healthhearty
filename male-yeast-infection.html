        Male Yeast Infection
      </h1>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Although male yeast infection is not generally talked about, it certainly exists. Given in this article, are some of the various causes, and a little more information in general, on male yeast infection...</p> <p>Many people, obviously males, believe that yeast infection occurs only in women. This is completely untrue, as a yeast infection can occur, and does occur, in males as well. Male yeast infection, unfortunately, tends to go undiagnosed due to the fact that most males do not think that they are prone to a yeast infection. This gives rise to statistics that show a much higher number of females suffering from this condition, hence, supporting the erroneous idea that males cannot be affected by a yeast infection.</p> <p>Yeast infection in males can occur in different places, with the mouth, skin, and genitals being the most prominent places where the infection occurs. However, the most common of these is penile yeast infection, or yeast infection affecting the genitals.</p> <h2>Symptoms</h2> <p>If you are suffering from a yeast infection, there are certain symptoms that will begin to develop, and these can be a good indication that you need to visit a doctor, to be treated. Note that not all symptoms may be seen, and by no means are these symptoms the only yardstick to diagnose if you are suffering from a yeast infection.</p> <p>Here are a few of the common symptoms.n<ul>n<li>Bad Breath</li>n<li>Constipation</li>n<li>Indigestion</li>n<li>Frequent Intestinal Gas</li>n<li>Abnormal Loose Stools</li>n<li>Sexual Dysfunction</li>n<li>Mood Swings</li>n<li>Frequent Fatigue</li>n<li>Loss of Energy</li>n<li>Irritability</li>n<li>Prostate Problems</li>n<li>Athlete's Feet</li>n<li>Bloating</li>n<li>Indigestion</li>n<li>Memory Loss (in extreme cases)</li>n</ul></p> <p>In addition to these, there are some more indications of a penile yeast infection, and they include:n<ul>n<li>Burning sensation during intercourse and urinating</li>n<li>The tip of the penis appears red</li>n<li>The penis develops small reddish-whitish blisters</li>n<li>The skin becomes itchy and flaky</li>n<li>The entire genital area shows signs of blisters, bumps, or rash</li>n<li>The penis becomes sore, especially to touch</li>n<li>A whitish discharge is seen, especially under the foreskin</li>n<li>The head of the penis may become swollen</li>n<li>The penile skin may become dry and prone to cracking when an erection is attained</li>n</ul></p> <h2>Causes</h2> <p>There are various causes of yeast infection, and these range from drinking too much beer, to wearing or remaining in wet underclothes. The main causes of a yeast infection in men are as follows:n<ul>n<li>Sexual Intercourse</li>n<li>Poor Genital Hygiene</li>n<li>Bacterial Infection</li>n<li>Allergies (to latex and condoms)</li>n<li>Antibiotics</li>n<li>Diabetes</li>n<li>Nonoxynol-9</li>n</ul></p> <p>Apart from these, there are a few more cases where one can get a yeast infection. Uncircumcised men are at a greater risk of getting a yeast infection, since the foreskin holds more moisture. HIV positive men also face a great risk of getting a yeast infection. In the case of gay men, the use of condoms are known to attribute to yeast infections. The lubricant containing nonoxynol-9 acts as a contributing factor to anal yeast infection in men. Nonoxynol-9 is known to contribute to the development of vaginal yeast infections in women.</p> <p>Yeast infection can also occur in young boys too. In the incident that feces touches the penis, the bacteria in the feces can cause a yeast infection. Diaper rash can also cause penile yeast infection. Damp clothing is another reason of such penile yeast infections, because the dampness provides an excellent atmosphere for the bacteria to grow and multiply. Children also face a chronic oral cavity yeast infection, in which there are white patches around the mouth.</p> <p>This generally happens between the age of six and nine. Male yeast infection can occur in men of all ages. Men who are sexually active or engage in certain sexual activities are more prone to yeast infections. Such yeast infections can also be transmitted sexually during unprotected sexual intercourse. If your female sexual partner is infected with a yeast infection, then it is always suggested to get yourself checked for yeast infection.</p> <p>Most times, if treated on time, this infection is a minor problem. It can be treated with ointments and antifungal creams. There are many prescription drugs available in the market which are known to treat penile yeast infections.</p> <p>Men generally contract yeast infections due to females. If the female has herself treated for a yeast infection, while the male hasn't, chances are that the female may contract the yeast infection during the next sexual intercourse. Therefore, till the time both partners have not checked and cured their yeast infection, it will continue to be a vicious circle. If men are facing yeast infections, they should have their fasting glucose level checked.</p>
