This list has been compiled alphabetically to further the cause of convenient readability. The causative agents, too, have been mentioned along with the disease. There are a number of diseases mentioned in this list, deemed endemic in regions, where thorough medical aid and amenities are scarce. They may, even be unavailable. Besides, certain infections have no preventive vaccines, while for some, vaccines are being processed. However, in most countries, AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria are the three maladies responsible for an increase in mortality rates.</span></p> <h3>Bacterial Infectious Diseases</h3> <p><ul>n<li><span><strong>Anthrax:</strong> multiplication of Bacillus anthracis in the body.</span></li>n<li><span><strong>Bacterial meningitis:</strong> inflammation of the protective membranes of the central nervous system, due to Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae.</span></li>n<li><span><strong>Botulism:</strong> blockage of nerve function and respiratory, as well as musculoskeletal paralysis due to toxins from Clostridium botulinum.</span></li>n<li><span><strong>Brucellosis:</strong> entrance of Brucella spp. bacteria by direct contact or untreated/contaminated milk of animals.</span></li>n<li><span><strong>Campylobacteriosis:</strong> an inflammatory and at times bloody diarrhea or dysentery caused by Campylobacter jejuni.</span></li>n<li><span><strong> Cat scratch disease:</strong> also regarded as cat scratch fever, Teeny's Disease, or Subacute regional lymphadenitis is known to have been caused by the bacteria Bartonella henselae.
