    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>There are an increasing number of people who use liposuction to sculpt their bodies, hence, it is important for the layman to understand the basics of this procedure. We have tried to explain the same in this article.</p> <p>Whoever said \"Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder\", probably did not imagine that increasingly a large number of men and women would be turning to liposuction to improve their aesthetic value in the eyes of the beholder. Liposuction happens to be one of the most popular techniques used by people all over the world to remove the excess body fat, especially in areas that could render the entire body unappealing. There are also others who undergo liposuction because they have been medically advised to do so.</p> <p>Dr. Giorgio Fischer, a gynecologist from Rome, Italy, invented liposuction in 1974. Liposuction is defined as the removal of fat from deposits beneath the skin using a hollow stainless steel tube called a \"cannula\" with the assistance of a powerful vacuum. Liposuction can be accomplished either with the use of general or local anesthesia. One of the types is called Tumescent Liposuction where local anesthesia is injected into the fat. However, if the procedure is done on the same day, can lead to complications. It could result in depressions or hollows in the skin, discoloring or disfiguring could also occur. The diameter of the \"cannula\" used is also a factor.</p> <p>Some of the older liposuction techniques have been abandoned because they were too risky to be implemented. For example, the Dry Technique, which derived its name from the fact that injections of local anesthesia were given in the fat before liposuction. This technique was abandoned because of the excessive blood loss it caused which had the risk of the patient going in shock.</p> <p>As we age, our faces begin to show the effects of gravity, sun exposure and years of facial muscle movement, such as smiling, chewing and squinting. The underlying tissues that keep our skin youthful and plumped up begin to break down, often leaving laugh lines, smile lines and facial creases. </p> <p>One of the most famous amongst these are Botox Injections. The cosmetic form of botulinum toxin, is a popular non-surgical injection that temporarily reduces or eliminates frown lines, forehead creases and thick bands in the neck. The toxin blocks the nerve impulses, temporarily paralyzing the muscles that cause wrinkles while giving the skin a smoother, more refreshed appearance. Botox has been used by many Hollywood personalities on big nights such as the Oscars, where they have to look nothing less than perfect on the red carpet.</p> <p>A patient can contribute to the procedure and minimize the risks involved, by ensuring that his doctor has the requisite advanced surgical qualifications to perform procedures that involve the removal of a large amount of fat. It is important that the patient speaks to some of the other patients who were treated by the doctor. It is extremely crucial that the patient knows what kind of pre-operative care he/she should take, before the liposuction is conducted. Even though a well-trained surgeon and a state-of-the art facility can improve your chance of having a good result, there are no guarantees.</p> <p>Ultimately, excellence is measured in terms of patient happiness, which is a function of safety, patient comfort, aesthetics, and quality of results.</p>"

    "post_name": "what-is-testosterone",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Testosterone maketh a man! It is the Y chromosome that differentiates men from the rest of humanity, from females generally.</p> <p>Responsible for making a man complete, testosterone has that effect on men that differentiates them from all those feminine qualities that the world accepts. Interestingly so, it is only one of the many male hormones that a man may have, but as has already been proven, it is the most important one. Even more interesting a fact is that male hormones, as we all know, are known as androgens, which in Greek literally means 'man maker'.</p> <h3>Biological Makeup</h3> <p>Biologically speaking, the 'Y' chromosomes cause one to form a protein called H-Y antigen, which prompt the gonads to form testicles. And it is on the development of these testicles that there is a creation of certain cells which pump out testosterone. Furthermore, it is testosterone that calls the shots. It gives all the manly features, which is so typically, well, 'male'. Testosterone levels are known to create miniature havoc situations from time to time. Besides the many things that it does to give one a male body, it also allows the generation of the sex organs, including the prostate. And when we are into talking about liberation and equality of women, let them not get left behind. Women too possess some amounts of it, providing them with a muscular shape, hoarseness in voice, (found amongst some women), and body hair.</p> <p>Once all the parts in a male are done with, especially so in a fetus, these levels are seen to be on the rise during the time of pregnancy. Testosterone moves around with ease in the uterus and within the baby, and does so in a rhytmatic manner. If you notice, most women pregnant with a male unborn child tend to have a natural glow on their faces. Although still at the stages of research, it is believed that this is due to the testosterone in the body of the woman carrying the child. Women expecting girls, on the other hand, look a little tired and worn out. Although you can never generalize what the lady may be in for by the looks of it, it's quite interesting to make such notes.</p> <h3>The Testosterone Level Check</h3> <p>Testosterone levels alter from time to time. For example, at the age of 50, these levels in some males tend to decline, although this is mostly seen in males reaching their seventh decade of life. Like women face the 'menopause' situation, we could term this situation in males to be the 'male menopause'. And if you have been a person whose lost a lot of his years in thinking to get the right type of sexual gratification, then you are more likely to have a reduced testosterone level. This may also be accompanied by thinning of hair, a sudden vocal change, marred with even lower sex drive.</p> <p>Women tend to understand a man's position most amicably as their levels of estrogen decrease. With an incessant research on the growth hormone, it is quite possible that this situation may also be dealt with. The growth hormone promises you to push at least 20 years of your life forward, retarding the age signs of gray hair, dull skin, and wrinkles, to diminishing in the thin air. But until that becomes a reality, it's only a matter of time before these signs are totally eradicated.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Leukemia is a condition that results from the abnormal growth of white blood cells in the human body. This article deals with the symptoms and treatment options for the same...</p> <p>Leukemia, also known as blood cancer, is the cancer of the blood cells. It originates and spreads in the blood and bone marrow, where the formation of the red blood cells, the white blood cells, and the platelets takes place. While the red blood cells are responsible for the supply of oxygen to our body, and the platelets help our blood clot, the white blood cells function in order to keep our body safe from infections and illnesses. In other words, the white blood cells provide us with immunity against illnesses.</p> <p>It is a sudden and uncontrollable increase in the count of these white blood cells in the blood and in the bone marrow that amounts to leukemia. These abnormally grown cells are known as the <i>leukemia cells</i>. They do not perform the function of the normal white blood cells, there is such an explosion in their number, and they tend to outgrow all the normal blood cells. This sudden increase in their number may lead to serious problems such as anemia, bleeding due to decrease in the number of platelets, or several allergic reactions.</p> <h3>Types of Leukemia</h3> <p>In general terms, leukemia is divided into two kinds, viz. <i>acute</i> and <i>chronic</i>. A patient having acute leukemia tends to feel sick with immediate effect, as it spreads very fast. A patient of chronic leukemia, however, may not even realize that he has been affected for years together, as it tends to spread very slowly. Again, on the basis of the kind of white blood cells that are affected, leukemia is divided into two categories, viz. <i>Lymphocytic</i>, meaning the one which affects white blood cells called lymphocytes, and <i>Myelogenous</i>, meaning the one which affects white blood cells called myelocytes. So, in general, the four main types of leukemia are:<ul><li>Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)</li><li>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)</li><li>Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)</li><li>Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)</li></ul>What causes leukemia is a subject of debate among most experts. However, people who have been never exposed to such risks may also be prone to leukemia.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p><strong><i>Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia</i></strong>n<ul>n<li>Fever, the cause of which is unknown</li>n<li>Weariness</li>n<li>Weakness</li>n<li>Constant bleeding</li>n<li>Pain in the bones</li>n<li>Swollen abdomen</li>n<li>Repeated infections and allergies</li>n<li>Red spots on the skin</li>n</ul>n<strong><i>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</i></strong>n<ul>n<li>Sudden and rapid weight loss</li>n<li>Weakness and fatigue</li>n<li>Fever</li>n<li>Painful abdomen, sometimes caused due to an enlarged spleen</li>n<li>Enlargement of lymph nodes, but no pain</li>n<li>Night sweat</li>n<li>Recurrent infections</li>n</ul></p> <p><strong><i>Acute Myelogenous Leukemia</i></strong>n<ul>n<li>Sudden fever</li>n<li>Bruises on the skin</li>n<li>Fatigue</li>n<li>Frequent and recurrent infections</li>n<li>Breathlessness</li>n<li>Pale skin</li>n<li>Bleeding from the nose and gums</li>n</ul>n<strong><i>Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</i></strong>n<ul>n<li>Continuous and uncontrollable bleeding</li>n<li>Fever</li>n<li>Lethargy</li>n<li>Rapid weight loss</li>n<li>Loss of Appetite</li>n<li>Night sweat</li>n</ul></p> <p><span>Symptoms may differ from person to person depending on what kind of leukemia he or she is affected by. Moreover, even if two given persons have been affected with the same type of leukemia, the symptoms they show may differ from each other as every human body is unique in its own way. However, some common symptoms which can be experienced at this juncture may include:</span>n<ul>n<li>Frequent occurrence of bruises</li>n<li>Bleeding that cannot be stopped easily</li>n<li>Frequent headaches</li>n<li>Lack of hunger and rapid weight loss</li>n<li>Tonsil infection</li>n<li>High fever</li>n<li>Diarrhea</li>n<li>Fatigue</li>n<li>Severe pneumonia</li>n<li>Chills</li>n<li>Night sweat</li>n<li>Swelling in lymph nodes leading to nausea</li>n</ul></p> <p><span>It is very important to note that there is no prescribed manual that describes the causes and symptoms of leukemia. Like every other kind of cancer, leukemia also brings about certain bodily changes within a person, that may further lead to a more acute kind of disorder. However, if and when one notes any of the common symptoms that may be of leukemia, he should not delay the matter any further, and consult a doctor immediately. After all, prevention is always better than cure.</span></p> <h3>Treatment Options</h3> <p>On complete physical examination, a doctor would check for any kind of swelling in the lymph nodes, or an enlargement in your liver or spleen. One would also be asked to do a blood test so that the doctor can also check for any kind of increase in the count of the white blood cells, and for reduction in the count of the red blood cells and the platelets. Sometimes, a patient may suffer from <i>aleukemia</i>.</p> <p>Aleukemia is a state where all the cancerous cells which are formed in the bone marrow stay within the bone marrow itself, and do not spread across the rest of the body. In such a case, an increase in the number of cancerous cells is not noticeable in the blood report. For dealing with this situation, one might be asked to do a bone marrow biopsy, a test that can check the cells inside one's bone marrow. It is only after checking for all such possibilities that a doctor is actually able to diagnose whether the patient is suffering from leukemia, and if yes, then the nature of the same. Once this procedure is completed, the doctor begins with the actual treatment.</p> <p>Leukemia treatment, again, differs on the basis of its kind and severity. It also depends upon the past medical record of the patient. The age of the patient is also another important factor. <i>Acute leukemia</i> needs quick and immediate treatment, because in such a case, the rapid growth of white blood cells can be stopped or at least be remitted. <i>Chronic leukemia</i>, however, is rarely curable. This is because, in many instances, the symptoms just don't show up. Therefore, diagnosing it becomes difficult, due to which, it rarely gets noticed in the early stages.</p> <p>Some of the treatment options that the patients of leukemia often undergo include:n<ul>n<li><i>Chemotherapy</i>, which is the main treatment of all kinds of leukemia. It involves using medicines that aid in killing cancerous cells.</li>n<li><i>Radiation therapy</i>, which uses powerful X-rays to kill cancerous cells.</li>n<li><i>Stem cell transplant</i>, which facilitates the supply of normal blood cells in the body.</li>n</ul>nApart from these common methods, there are some other specialized treatment options as well, but they majorly depend on the kind of leukemia, and the doctor who is doing the treatment.</p> <p>Researchers have been constantly trying to find out new ways and means in order to diagnose and treat leukemia in a better manner. Numerous clinical trials happen every year that test new medicines and treatments that can help in curing leukemia. At times, people suffering from serious leukemia take part in such clinical trials, and sometimes their cancer is successfully cured or at least remitted. But while making any such attempt, one needs to keep in mind that such tests also have a large risk factor involved, as they may sometimes lead to incurable side effects. The most feasible way is to consult an experienced doctor immediately, and follow his course of treatment sincerely and religiously.</p> <p><i>Disclaimer: This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>You must have suffered from heartburn at some point or the other. It is the burning sensation that occurs in your chest and throat after you have eaten a good meal. Learn more about it in this article.</p> <p>There are times when good food is not a good thing. All of us have suffered from a pain in the chest after having a particularly sumptuous meal. This pain is called heartburn. Heartburn affects about 40% of the population. Heartburn has nothing to do with the heart - it is more of a digestive issue. Heartburn is a pain behind the breastbone. It is often described as though the chest is on fire. Some pain can also be felt at the same level in the mid-line of the back. Heartburn of course, is not the only kind of pain that occurs in the heart. Angina is a pain in the chest due to a temporary shortage of oxygen being carried in the blood to the heart muscle. If the pain is felt intensely in the center of the chest, spreading perhaps to one or both the arms then it could be a heart attack.</p> <p>Heartburn is caused because of the acid that is present in the stomach to digest food. Heartburn occurs when small amounts of this acid are regurgitated into the esophagus, the tube, which carries food from the mouth to the stomach. This is known as reflux. At the bottom of the gullet there is a muscle, which, through contraction, acts as a barrier to keep the acid in the stomach. If this doesn't work properly, reflux occurs. The stomach has a protective lining that prevents the acids from burning it, but the esophagus has no such protection. When it comes in contact with the acid, it becomes inflamed and painful. The consumption of large quantities of food is not the only cause of heartburn. Anything that can direct the acid into the esophagus can cause heartburn. The other known causes are bending a lot, pregnancy, smoking and something as mundane as wearing tight clothing around the waist. There is also a condition called hiatus hernia that interferes with the working of the esophagus muscle; hence, many of its sufferers are heartburn patients.</p> <p>Heartburn in itself is not a life-threatening condition but it could get worse if the esophagus becomes scarred and constricted. Difficulty in swallowing, especially lumpy foods, may be a result of this. Acid reflux can sometimes result in serious complications. Esophagitis, an inflammation of the esophagus that can lead to esophageal bleeding or ulcers, can occur as a result of the frequent exposure of esophagus to the stomach acid. Some people develop a condition known as Barrett's esophagus, a change in the cells of the tissue lining the bottom of the esophagus that can increase the chance of developing cancer. Lung problems can also develop when reflux causes stomach fluid to overflow into the breathing tubes.</p> <p>A number of simple measures can be adopted to reduce the occurrence of heartburn. Some foods and beverages that increase the risk of reflux must be consumed in moderation. These include alcohol; coffee, tea and cola drinks; carbonated beverages; citrus fruits and juices; tomatoes and tomato sauces; chocolate; spicy and fatty foods. Make it a point to eat frequent and smaller meals. A full stomach is generally a precursor to heartburn. Don't go to bed as soon as the meal is over. There must be a contingency period within which the digestive action takes place. Smoking is a sure way to invite heartburn. When you are sleeping try to keep your head on an incline for support. If the body and head are perfectly aligned, it puts pressure on the stomach. Placing a pillow under the head helps reduce this pressure. If wine has to be consumed then white wine is the safer option vis-\u00e0-vis red wine.</p> <p>People have resorted to medical treatment when heartburn has occurred. They prefer consuming antacids to anything else. The antacid works by forming a layer over the stomach lining. Often antacids contain a seaweed product called alginate, which floats on the stomach contents in an attempt to keep them down. This provides relief to the sufferer. The stronger option is medicine that prevents the formation of the acid in the stomach. But this is administered when the pain is acute and heartburn occurrence is frequent. There are people who have opted for surgery when confronted with heartburn. If hiatus hernia has occurred, then it is corrected. The surgeon stitches the upper few centimeters of the stomach around the esophagus to prevent the recurring of heartburn.</p> <p>An unfortunate mistake that people continue to make is to not pay attention when heartburn occurs. Since heartburn is relatively innocuous people just rest for a while and it goes away. But they tend to do the same thing when they mistake a heart attack for a heartburn and the results are fatal.</p> <p>This material is not intended as a guide to self-medication by consumers.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by weakening of the immune system on contracting the notorious Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This virus specifically attacks the immune cells called T-helper cells, which leads to increased susceptibility to infections.</p> <h3>Did You Know?</h3> <p>A specific genetic defect in a set of people with European and Asian heritage has rendered them resistant to AIDS.</p> <p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is one of the most notorious viruses, and affects about 50,000 people ever year in the USA alone. This virus infects several types of cells in the body including a set of white blood cells called T-helper (T<sub>h</sub>) cells. Reduction in the number of T-helper cells weakens the immune system, ultimately leading to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which is characterized by increased bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections.<br><br>In an infected individual, HIV is present in the genital fluids and blood. Hence it gets transmitted sexually as well as through the use of infected syringes, transfusion of infected blood, and on contact of a wound with the infected fluids. The virus also spreads from an infected mother to the child during pregnancy, delivery, or through breast milk. After transmission, the virus may persist in a latent state for several years before leading to AIDS.<br><br>The interaction of HIV with T-helper cells, as well as the different stages of HIV infection have been explained below.</p> <h2>HIV and T-helper Cells</h2> <p>HIV belongs to the family of retroviruses, which are RNA (ribonucleic acid) viruses characterized by their ability to synthesize DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) from RNA by a process called <em>reverse transcription</em>. The HIV genome comprises two copies of single stranded RNA (ssRNA). These RNA molecules and the enzymes required for multiplication of the virus are enclosed inside a conical protein structure called <em>capsid</em>. The capsid is surrounded by an envelope that is similar to the cell membrane of human cells.<br><br>T-helper cells are the main targets of HIV, and are also called CD4 positive cells due to the presence of a specialized protein called CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) on their cell surface. These cells are a type of soldier cells present in the body, and play an important role in detecting foreign bodies and pathogens, as well as activating other cells of the immune system. HIV attacks these cells, multiplies inside them, and ultimately destroys them. In simple terms, HIV reprograms the T-helper cells into HIV-producing cells. This replication cycle of HIV occurs through the following sequence of events.</p> <h3>Attachment and Entry</h3> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> </div> <p>The HIV envelope contains specialized protein stems onto which a set of glycoproteins called gp120 are attached. These glycoproteins can identify and bind to CD4 molecules present on T-helper cells. This interaction is analogous to lock and key interaction, and serves as a gate opener for HIV. Once HIV docks onto the cell membrane of T-helper cells, fusion of the viral and cellular membranes occurs, and the viral capsid is released into the cytoplasm.</p> <h3>Reverse Transcription and Integration</h3> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> </div> <p>The viral capsid contains the enzymes necessary for the synthesis of new viral particles from the RNA strands by using cellular machinery of the host cell. One of these enzymes is the <em>reverse transcriptase&nbsp;</em> that synthesizes a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule from the existing viral ssRNA. The enzyme first creates a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) from viral ssRNA, which is termed as reverse transcription. Using this DNA strand as a template, the enzyme then creates the second strand of DNA molecule, thus giving rise to a dsDNA molecule. The virus does not have its own set of nucleotide bases, and uses those present in the cytoplasm of the T-helper cells.<br><br>The dsDNA is tightly bound to a viral enzyme called <em>integrase</em>, and is transported into the nucleus by the cellular transport machinery of T-helper cells. Inside the nucleus, integrase enables the integration of the viral DNA into the DNA of T-helper cells. Using this mechanism the virus can hide and stay in the body in a latent state for several years.</p> <h3>Protein Synthesis</h3> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> </div> <p>The T-helper cell nucleus, like every cell of the body, contains enzymes for generating messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules from the DNA present in the nucleus. These mRNA molecules contain all the information necessary for producing cellular proteins.<br><br>By integrating its DNA into the host DNA, HIV exploits this process for creation of mRNA molecules that contain the information for synthesis of viral proteins. The mRNA molecules generated in the nucleus travel outside into the cytoplasm, where long chains of viral proteins are synthesized by the protein synthesis machinery of T-helper cells. These long chains are cut into individual protein units by the viral enzyme protease. Thus, the infected T-helper cell is now completely under control of HIV, and works as a virus-producing factory.</p> <h3>Packaging and Budding</h3> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> </div> <p>The newly created viral proteins, RNA, and enzymes gather near the membrane of the T-helper cell. The newly synthesized viral enzymes attach to the new RNA, and the viral proteins assemble around this complex to form the new viral capsid. This capsid attaches to the inner side of the membrane, and the remaining viral proteins get inserted into the cell membrane near the viral capsid. The viral capsid then pushes itself against the cell membrane and buds off as a mature virion, taking an envelope of the cell membrane along with it. Such budding of the mature virions disrupts the integrity of T-helper cells, thereby leading to their destruction. The new virions infect and destroy other T-helper cells. Thus, the number of virions begins to increase, and the number of T-helper cells begins to decrease.</p> <h2>Stages of HIV Infection</h2> <p>On contraction of HIV, individuals may remain asymptomatic for a long period of time or experience flu-like symptoms called <em>acute retroviral syndrome (ARS)&nbsp;</em> in about 2-4 weeks. This stage of primary infection is called <strong>acute infection</strong>, and is characterized by active multiplication of the virus and reduction of T-helper cells. Frequent fever, muscle and joint pain, swollen lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal problems are some of the common symptoms. In this stage, the immune response against the virus helps to limit viral multiplication, and the counts of T-helper cells increase to normal. Antibodies are generated against HIV and are present in the blood of infected individuals, which serves as a diagnostic criteria for HIV infection.<br><br>However, the body is unable to get rid of the virus, and it persists in an inactive state. This stage is termed <strong>clinical latency</strong>, and can last for 1-2 years or even 15 years. This time period depends on several factors including the individual's immune strength, diet, age, medical history, and prevailing medical conditions (if any). Nevertheless, the virus cannot be controlled forever by the immune system, and the viral replication increases, in turn affecting the T-helper cells. In addition, the death of uninfected T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells has also been observed in HIV patients.<br><br>Once the number of T-helper cells drops below 200 cells per \u00b5L, opportunistic infections occur. This stage is known as <strong>AIDS</strong>, and is characterized by muscle wasting, candidiasis, pneumocystis pneumonia (pneumonia caused by the fungus <em>Pneumocystis</em>), and other respiratory tract infections. Moreover, the individual is at risk of developing virus-induced cancers. Infections affect nearly every organ of the body, ultimately leading to the demise of the patient.</p> <p>The stages of HIV infection, as identified by the World Health Organization (WHO), along with the corresponding T-helper cell counts (CD4 counts) are as summarized below.<br><br>n<div class=\"ct-table-wrap\">n<table class=\"ct-table ct-table-bordered\">n<tbody>n<tr>n<td><strong>Stage</strong></td>n<td><strong>Characteristics</strong></td>n<td><strong>CD4 count</strong><br><strong>(cells per \u00b5l of blood)</strong></td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td><strong>Primary HIV infection</strong></td>n<td>Asymptomatic or ARS</td>n<td>&gt; 500</td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td><strong>Stage I</strong></td>n<td>Asymptomatic or lymph node enlargement</td>n<td>&gt; 500</td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td><strong>Stage II</strong></td>n<td>Upper respiratory tract infections</td>n<td>350 - 500</td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td><strong>Stage III</strong></td>n<td>Chronic diarrhea, bacterial infections</td>n<td>200 - 350</td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td><strong>Stage IV (AIDS)</strong></td>n<td>Candidiasis and other fungal, parasitic and bacterial infections</td>n<td>&lt; 200</td>n</tr>n</tbody>n</table>n</div>n*Normal CD4 count: 500-1000 cells per \u00b5l of blood</p> <p>AIDS epidemic has survived for the past few decades, and HIV continues to find new hosts in the form of those who practice unsafe sex, those who accidentally use infected syringes, and those who receive blood from an infected person.</p>"

This results in joint inflammation and the destruction of connective tissue and cartilage surrounding the joints. A rather painful condition that requires great care and therapy, Rheumatoid Arthritis, can be controlled and eradicated with the help of your own will power.</p> <p>Symptoms of this kind of arthritis include joint stiffness, tenderness, and swelling, as well as fatigue, anemia, and crippling pain. Further, painful arthritic nodes develop at pressure points, such as the elbows and knees. In the final stage of the disease, the patient generally has joint defects, muscle destruction, soft tissue tumors, and bone and cartilage degeneration, as well as ankylosis.</p> <p>Medical treatment includes rest, exercise to improve joint function, drugs to reduce pain and inflammation, surgery to prevent or correct defects, and a nutritional diet. Steroids are given with caution because of their known side effects.</p> <p>In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, the tissue type most frequently found in patients is HL-DR4. The bacteria that most closely matches the characteristics of HL-DR4 is Proteus, a common cause of urinary tract infections. Interestingly enough, women, who have a much higher rate of urinary tract infections than men, also suffer from rheumatoid arthritis twice as often as men.</p> <p>There was a time when Proteus was identified as close in characteristics to HL-DR4 tissue types. When levels of Proteus antibodies found in the blood of people with rheumatoid arthritis were compared with those of healthy people, the levels were much higher in the people suffering from RA. When strong armies of beneficial bacteria are on guard to control the overgrowth of Proteus, many symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis can be eliminated.</p> <h3>Recommended Probiotic Regimen</h3> <p>In addition to the following a probiotic regimen, those with rheumatoid arthritis may consider taking 1 tablespoon of emulsified cod liver oil, which helps to minimize pain.</p> <p>In addition to the above regimen, for increased strength, take 1 combination capsule that contains all three super strains in an oil-matrix carrier, one to three times daily. But most important instruction to be borne in mind is a good and healthy diet.</p> <p>Leafy vegetables, almonds, at least 2 glasses of skimmed milk and adequate amount of stretching exercises, coupled with regular morning walks can keep RA at bay.</p>"

They help build muscle tissue and increase body mass, by acting like the body's natural male hormone, testosterone.</p> <p>Lower doses of anabolic steroids, sometimes, are used to treat a handful of very serious medical conditions. They should not be confused with corticosteroids, which are used to treat common medical conditions such as asthma and arthritis. Although corticosteroids are strong medications, they do not have muscle-building effects. Anabolic steroids are the ones abused by athletes and others who look for a shortcut to becoming bigger and stronger.</p> <p>Although steroids cannot improve an athlete's agility or skill, there are many who swear by it. There are many factors that help determine athletic ability, including genetics, body size, age, sex, diet, and how hard the athlete trains. It is clear that the medical dangers of steroid use far outweigh the advantage of gains in strength or muscle mass. There are several problems that regular steroid usage can have on one's body. As there are many changes that take place inside the body, these may not be noticed until it is too late. Some of the effects go away when you stop, but this may not be the case for every type of steroid used.</p> <h3>Males</h3> <p>One of the more disturbing effects of steroid use by males is that the body begins to produce less of its own testosterone. As a result, the testicles may begin to shrink. Men also tend to lose hair, both on the body as well as the scalp. Here are some more effects on males:</p> <p>Reduced sperm count<br>Impotence<br>Increase in nipple and breast size<br>Enlarged prostate</p> <h3>Females</h3> <p>There are many women who try out steroids in their tryst to develop their own biceps. Since steroids act as a male hormone, females may also experience the following side effects.</p> <p>Reduced breast size<br>Enlarged clitoris<br>Increase in facial and body hair<br>Deepened voice<br>Menstrual problems</p> <p>If you truly want to experiment, it's best if you do so under medical consultation, or else it's only a matter of time before you experience strong negative consequences.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Brain hemorrhage is a kind of severe stroke that can kill a person or paralyze him for the rest of his life, if he is not subjected to proper treatment in time. Though serious, it is preventable, and to prevent it you need to be aware of its causes and symptoms.</p> <p>Brain hemorrhage is a type of stroke wherein damage induced to the artery results in localized bleeding in the brain, and destroys the tissues and cells in the vicinity. When the rupture caused to the wall of the blood vessels results in blood spill, the blood enters the area wherein vital tissues and cells of brain are located and kills them. It is a severe condition, wherein the person needs immediate medication/treatment - if the person is not subjected to proper treatment in time, it can result in further complications like loss of brain function and cause coma or death.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>Right from high blood pressure to brain tumor - any condition which causes the blood vessels to weaken can make you vulnerable to brain hemorrhage. In fact, 80 percent of the patients are known to have a history of high blood pressure. Other common conditions which contribute to weakening of blood vessels include head trauma (common in people under 50), aneurysm (which results in swelling of blood vessel walls thus making them vulnerable to bursting), blood vessel abnormalities (like amyloid angiopathy in aged people), bleeding disorders such as hemophilia and anemia, formation of some substances in the blood vessels which are carried along with blood to the brain, brain functional malformation, etc.</p> <p><b>In fact, you are at a high risk of suffering from this condition, if</b>n<ul>n<li>You are constantly under pressure/stress in your personal or professional life.</li>n<li>You have a family history of brain hemorrhage.</li>n<li>You have weak blood vessels due to some underlying condition.</li>n<li>You have a mutation in cystatin C gene.</li>n<li>You suffer from chronic high blood pressure.</li>n<li>You drink or smoke (or resort to substance abuse) very often.</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Even though brain hemorrhage occurs in a flash without any warning in most of the cases, some symptoms are considered to be the warning bells for impending disaster. You should look out for these hemorrhage symptoms to figure out if you are vulnerable to it. A sudden and very intense headache, vomiting/nausea are most common symptoms. If you experience that your body parts are not responding to your will, i.e., if you feel paralyzed or in other words if you feel sudden numbness in body organs (this may be a momentary condition), then you should consult your physician for further diagnosis. In case of pinprick hemorrhages in the brain, the leakage of blood starts very slowly and very small quantity of blood spills out of the vessel in the sensitive area of the brain. In such cases, the patient does not get a severe stroke, but he slowly starts losing his consciousness.</p> <h3>Diagnosis and Treatment</h3> <p>There are series of tests that are used to diagnose a condition which is likely to lead to a hemorrhage. A CT (Computerized Tomography) scan or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan can help find out where the hemorrhage has occurred. Lumbar puncture - i.e. surgical removal of fluid from the subarachnoid\u00a0space of the lumbar region of the spinal\u00a0cord for diagnostic purpose, angiography - imaging done by injecting a radio-opaque contrast agent into the blood vessel, etc., are other tests that are used in the diagnosis of brain hemorrhage.</p> <p>The treatment depends on its location and severity, so does the success of any surgery. Diagnostic radiology, interventional radiology and microsurgical techniques are a few treatment options available for hemorrhage. The doctor will select the best option depending on the type of hemorrhage. In most cases, surgery is employed in order to remove the spilled blood, and is followed by a stitch to the artery to stop the blood leakage. Treating it by surgery has its own pros and cons. While the patient can successfully come out of the deadly situation, in some cases he may end up losing his life. At times, the patient may even have to sacrifice the functionality of the affected organ as a consequence of a hemorrhage stroke.</p> <p>As brain hemorrhage causes severe stroke in patients, recovery of the patient carries many possibilities - some patients resume their normal life after treatment (which can be a long-term or short-term treatment depending upon therapy used), while some end up losing the functionality of the organ which was affected by the stroke. It is very difficult to predict how much time recovery from hemorrhage will take as it is bound to differ from case to case.</p> <p>Though the fact that it can be fatal is quite alarming, the better part is that it can be prevented by identifying risk factors and working on them. Chronic blood pressure, for instance, is the biggest culprit when it comes to hemorrhage causes - which means treatment of hypertension can help you reduce the risk of suffering from brain hemorrhage. Same rule applies to other risk factors - such as head trauma, which can be prevented by taking necessary precautions like wearing helmet while riding a bike. With the consequences being so severe, it is wise to go by the age-old adage - prevention is better than cure.</p>"

    "post_name": "all-about-hay-fever",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Hay fever is a condition that affects 2 to 3 million people in Britain every year. It is caused by an allergic reaction to pollen and mold, and can get serious if not treated appropriately.</p> <p>Hay fever causes the body's immune system to overreact in the presence of external substances. This results in irritation and inflammation in the body at large. Often hay fever runs in families and it can also be related to asthma and eczema. It is quite common to find a family with some members affected with asthma, some with hay fever, and others with eczema. Any individual might have more than one of these conditions.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>The symptoms vary from person to person and often involve sneezing, runny/blocked nose; red, watery, and itchy eyes, and itchy throat. Very often there is also wheezing, which can suggest asthma.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>Different pollens are present at different times of year. So it's really difficult to gauge which pollen might have affected you, or the type of pollen that you may be allergic to. There are of course several factors that include both weather and air quality that may aggravate the situation that you already are in.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>There are various treatments available over the counter from a pharmacist. Antihistamine tablets are known to reduce the overall severity of the symptoms. There are nasal sprays containing steroids and other substances that reduce the local inflammatory response in the nose. There are also eye drops with similar effects. It is important to note that people with asthmatic symptoms need treatment for asthma and not for hay fever.</p> <p>Occasionally, the doctor may consider it necessary to prescribe either tablets containing steroids, or possibly an injection to ease your problem. These may have more serious side effects than the other treatments, so it's your pick really to weigh the possible benefits against the possible disadvantages. There are injection treatments to de-sensitize patients against the substance they may be allergic to. Unfortunately, these can bring on serious reactions, and can only be given under medical supervision.</p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p>Although you cannot really change the natural occurrences, there may be several ways to prevent them in these situations as well. These include:<br>* In the summers, stay indoors between 5 pm and 7 pm, when pollen counts are usually high. Keep windows and doors closed, especially while sleeping.<br>* Use an air conditioner or filter when possible, at home, work, and in the car, to remove pollen and other allergens from the air.<br>* Vacuum your home regularly, to minimize the presence of pollen and dust.<br>* Airing bedclothes in direct sunlight is also helpful.<br>* Be aware of the pollen count (usually broadcast along with the weather), and avoid areas of high pollen concentration, e.g. long grass, lawn mowings, and trees. If you are working in such an environment, consider wearing a mask and goggles.<br>* Avoid unnecessary irritants such as smoke and chemical fumes.</p> <p><i>Disclaimer: This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Cataracts is a term given to the medical condition where there is misting or hazing of the lens in your eye. Here, we look at the causes, symptoms, and treatment for this eye condition.</p> <p>Cataracts lead to poor vision and in some cases, even blindness. But in most cases, this condition can be remedied by a fairly minor operation.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Patients often complain about blurred vision, which is because the eye's lens becomes opaque. Some patients also complain about glares and reduction in contrast in their vision. There are complaints of reduction in the ability to differentiate between colors. From external inspection, doctors can see that there is clear clouding of the lens in some cases.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>The most common cause of cataracts is biological aging. The proteins present in the lens degrade as the age progresses. UV radiation, gene expression also compounds the symptoms as the person gets older. Hypertension, a common problem seen in old people can aggravate the condition.</p> <p>Injuries to the eye, such as blunt trauma can cause swelling and whitening of the lens. The swelling usually subsides but the whitening remains, clouding the vision.</p> <p>Radiation in the form of ultraviolet rays, microwaves, and X-rays also causes cataracts. Ultraviolet rays, especially UV-B are the main contributors to this eye condition. The radiation coagulates the proteins present in the lens, similar to the coagulation of the egg albumin where it becomes white after cooking.</p> <p>Chromosome abnormalities can also cause cataracts. Certain genetic disorders may lead to lens defects.</p> <p>Smoking is also seen as a major cause of cataracts. It has been shown to double the chances of a person to have this medical condition.</p> <p>There are still other conditions that affect your system as a whole for example, diabetes, that is linked with a higher risk of developing a cataract. Certain drugs, including corticosteroids, if not administered accurately may increase one's chances of developing cataracts.</p> <p>There are some rare instances where babies are born with cataracts (congenital cataract). In this case, it is very important that it gets detected early for the baby to develop normal vision.</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>Cataract is usually diagnosed by your ophthalmologist or optometrist. They use an elaborate apparatus called a slit-lamp for examining your eyes. The lens, which starts off as clear at birth may develop areas that are cloudy. Sometimes the cataract makes it difficult to see the back of the eye properly. A visual acuity test is generally recommended to gauge how well the patient is able to see.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>The effective treatments deal with removing the cloudiness of the lens. A process known as phacoemulsification is the most common treatment for cataracts. In this process, the eye is numbed with the help of local anesthesia in the form of simple eye drops. Then, two cuts are made in the cornea. A needle is used to create a small hole in the lens capsule. A probe that emits ultrasound waves is used to break up the lens. This dissolved emulsion is sucked away and simultaneously a saline solution is pumped in to prevent the collapse of the outer structure. A plastic foldable lens is then inserted in the capsule. Antibiotics may be injected after the procedure, to prevent any infections.</p> <p>If the cataracts are very hard and emulsification becomes difficult using ultrasound, a procedure known as Extracapsular Cataract Extraction is performed. Here, most of the lens is taken out leaving the capsule intact. An artificial lens is then inserted and the capsule is sutured where the incision was made.</p> <p>The post-operative recovery period is short. The patient is cautioned against lifting heavy weights, and is advised to wear an eye shield for a couple of weeks.</p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p>Wearing glasses that filter UV rays can delay the onset of cataract formation.</p> <p>Although researchers claim that consumption of antioxidants prevents cataracts, recent studies do not endorse this claim.</p> <p>If you smoke, and it is a habit, you need to break it.</p>"

    "post_name": "tennis-elbow-symptoms-causes-diagnosis-treatment",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis is a condition where the outer part of the elbow becomes painful and tender, usually as a result of repeated strain, overuse, or trauma to the region.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>The outer part of the elbow is rather painful and tender to touch. Movements of the elbow that involve lifting, with the hand on top can hurt real bad. Any sport, from badminton, to tennis, to golf involves both the massive movement of the wrist and the complete arm. The elbow is one such part which is most often neglected and once affected takes a rather long time to heal.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>Although called tennis elbow, lateral epicondylitis is also commonly seen in people who are over using their arm. It could equally well be called \"golfer's elbow\" or \"mechanic's elbow\" or \"painter's elbow\". The most common cause is the overuse of muscles that are attached to the elbow. This simply refers to all those muscles that pull the hand backwards. All extensor muscles of the hand attach to the elbow at the outer part (the lateral epicondyle). If they are strained or overused, they become inflamed, which means they become swollen, painful, and hence tender to touch.</p> <p>Regular massages could be one of the most important aspects in avoiding a situation like this, although you could never really guarantee that such a situation may not arise either ways too. Sometimes the inflammation is caused by a direct injury. Sometimes, when the cause is direct injury or strain, the muscles are partially torn.</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>Your doctor or physiotherapist may test for tenderness in the muscles attached to the elbow. He also tests to see whether the pain gets any worse when you bend the wrist back (extend it) against resistance. Diagnostic tests like an X-ray, ultrasonography and MRI may also be done. An X-ray may show signs of fracture and arthritis which may be causing the problem. MRI and sonography are done to see whether there is a buildup of fluid in the tender area and also the amount of swelling present in the affected area. These tests however are expensive, and hence are avoided.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>* Rest is advised to most of the affected patients. The activity that caused the problem is also best avoided till the pain recedes.<br>* Physiotherapy treatments like ice packs and ultrasound therapy helps in many cases.<br>* Use of anti-inflammatory drugs and ordinary pain killers (analgesics) are given to ease the pain.<br>* Your doctor may suggest an injection of a small dose of steroid to the affected area. If used, it can last for up to three months.<br>* Lastly, you can buy a brace from a sports shop or pharmaceutical supplier, which can be helpful. This is probably largely because it reduces the amount you can use your elbow, hence protecting it from awkward movements.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Angina pectoris, or angina, refers to a chest pain that occurs due to inadequate blood supply to the heart muscles. This article provides information regarding the same.</p> <p>Angina pectoris is recurring chest pain or discomfort that happens when some muscles of the heart do not receive enough oxygenated blood to carry out their pumping function efficiently. It is a symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD), which occurs when the coronary arteries become narrowed due to atherosclerosis, or blocked due to a blood clot.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>In this condition, you are likely to experience pain in the center of the chest, which may also travel into the neck, jaw, and arms (especially the left, where you heart is situated). The pain is usually described as a crushing or heavy or gripping pain. Sometimes you may also feel breathless.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>Angina is generally caused because the muscles of the heart do not receive enough oxygen (via the blood) for the work they are performing. This is because the blood vessels that supply the heart muscles with oxygen may have become narrowed due to high cholesterol buildup.</p> <p>Another reason is that the blood vessels begin to narrow down with age. Obese people and diabetics are also at a greater risk of this condition. It mostly follows physical exercise, but may also be triggered by emotional stress, heavy meals, or going out in cold weather, and smoking.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>If you think you have angina pectoris you should consult your doctor. He may well prescribe some tablets to keep under your tongue, or the same medication as a spray. They work by opening the blood vessels, and as a result may give a side effect of throbbing headache. However, this side effect usually wears off after the first two or three tablets.</p> <p>Angina usually lasts no longer than ten minutes, and if you get it you should stop what you are doing and take one of the tablets or a puff of the spray under your tongue. If your symptoms are not controlled by drugs, your doctor may refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist) for consideration of further treatment. It is likely that at this stage you would have a test to show up the blood vessels, which supply oxygen to the heart muscle.</p> <p>Further treatment is not necessary except in quite advanced cases which involves either using a tube to enlarge the blood vessels or bypassing the blood vessels with alternative vessels.</p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p>Here are some of the preventive measures for you:<ul><li>Do not smoke</li><li>Lose weight if you are over weight</li><li>Eat a low fat diet with a good fiber intake</li><li>Exercise regularly</li><li>Avoid unnecessary stress and learn relaxation techniques</li><li>Reduce the consumption of alcohol</li><li>Reduce the intake of salt in your diet</li></ul>Thus, making a healthy lifestyle change can help prevent the recurrence of angina.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p> <div class=\"buzzle-masonry-2\"> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/fruits-vegetables/lettuce/1200-497891665-red-lettuce-with-knife-on-board.jpg\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/fruits-vegetables/1280-482991159-carambola-or-starfruit-on-white.jpg\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/fruits-vegetables/1280-179098246-mangosteen.jpg\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/fruits-vegetables/lettuce/1200-532747885-green-lettuce.jpg\"></a> </div></div>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>As men age they are more likely to experience problems relating to the prostate gland. It is the gland which makes fluid for the semen. The following article provides information about the various symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment option available for this condition.</p> <h3>Symptoms of Prostate Problems</h3> <p>Prostate is a walnut-sized gland present only in men. It secretes a fluid which nourishes the sperms. Normally this gland grows naturally with age, however in some cases it may enlarge and cause pressure on the outflow tube. This causes problem in urination which may lead to a condition known as benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Occasionally men develop cancer of the prostate, which rarely causes any symptoms. However, in certain severe cases the person may develop BPH.</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>Your doctor will want to know more about any change in the flow or stream of urine, frequency, or the need to get up at night. He may also inquire about any difficulty while starting or stopping the passage of urine. He may examine the gland, which means examining, with a gloved finger, up the rectum. This will give a clue about the size of the prostate, and any possible evidence of cancer.</p> <p>Other tests include a blood test to check on kidney function, or a special blood test (PSA i.e. prostate specific antigen testing) to check for biochemical evidence of prostate cancer. PSA is a substance produced by the prostate gland, which is present in the blood of all men. As men get older the amount of this antigen in the blood slowly rises.</p> <p>In prostate cancer the PSA test usually shows a higher concentration of this antigen in the blood than would be expected. If the test shows a normal result this is reassuring, and if the result is high it is likely that your specialist will wish to embark on further tests and treatment. There is a level, which is just above the normal range, but not yet high, which might lead to your doctor repeating the test after a few months. In actuality, there is nothing as serious as this condition. It has been observed that, most couples with an active love life are less prone to problems of this gland. The doctor may suggest a urine test to check for infection, and a flow test to assess the speed at which the urine leaves the bladder. There may also be an ultrasound examination to take pictures of this gland. If the tests show positive results, then the doctor may advice a biopsy to confirm the condition. </p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>After several tests it may be apparent that the problem lies elsewhere (e.g. irritable bladder wall), or that there are varying degrees of obstruction due to the prostate. However, if there is severe obstruction, or any suspicion of cancer, your doctor can refer you directly to a urologist (kidney and bladder surgeon). If there are lesser degrees of obstruction or in the absence of evidence of cancer, your doctor may suggest some tablets, which might help the muscle wall of the outflow tube to open more or to slowly shrink the gland.</p> <p>There is a natural remedy that some men may wish to try, having had the preliminary tests, as an alternative to the prescription medications. This is a berry extract known as saw palmetto, which has been shown to be safe and effective, at least in mild to moderate cases. If it does not help you should be willing to consider the medication from your doctor, as back-pressure on the kidneys from the prostate can eventually lead to poor kidney function.</p> <p>In severe condition, you may require prostate surgery which is most frequently performed via the penis and does not involve an external scar. It consists of reaming out the protruding center of the gland, thus leaving a larger passage. Occasionally a major surgery is required which leaves a scar, usually above the pubic bone.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Introduction and information about rabies has become very rare but we need to be careful about and gain thorough knowledge about it, as prevention is always better than cure.</p> <p>Rabies is an infectious viral disease, which spreads through the saliva of an infected (i.e., rabid) animal to other animals or humans. The possible means of transmission, of rabies are animal bites or exposure of an open cut to the medium that contains the virus of rabies. In case of an infection, it is highly important to treat the infected person, and negligence in such cases can cause a painful death.</p> <p>As discussed above, animal bite is the single most prominent reason for the spread of rabies in humans (via their pets or wild carnivores). Rabid cats, dogs, raccoons, bats, foxes, skunks, weasels, groundhogs, cattle etc. are amongst the animals highly responsible for spreading rabies to humans.</p> <p>There are also some other wild carnivores, which work as a medium in transmission of rabies from one animal to other (for example: mongoose, squirrels, rabbits etc.). As awareness of the disease has spread all over the world, it is evident that the cases of getting infected through pets have become almost rare as compared to the spread of the disease through wild animal bites.</p> <h3>Effects on the Body</h3> <p>The rabies virus attacks the central nervous system in the infected animal or humans and causes a condition called encephalopathy. Some of the early symptoms of the disease includes problems related to the nervous systems, fever, general malaise and sometimes the patient experiences a strong headache.</p> <p>As the disease progresses, problems related to the nervous system increase and the patient experiences anxiety, excitation, insomnia, agitation, conditions like confusion and hallucinations, difficulty in swallowing, salivation, muscle pain, irritations, vomiting, the patient also sometimes develops phobias (hydrophobia being the most common), partial or full paralysis etc. This situation ultimately leads to death within a few days of the symptoms becoming more prominent.</p> <h3>If possibly bitten by an Infected Animal?</h3> <p>In case you are bitten by an animal (that you do not know is infected with rabies or not), all you need to do is, speak to your doctor as soon as possible and take help from the local health department to find out information about the animal and the possibility of you getting infected with rabies. Cleanse the wound with water and apply disinfectant. Get medical aid from your doctor. Also do not forget to ask him about the preventive measures as well as the necessary precautions to be taken.</p> <h2>Prevention</h2> <p>Rabies can be cured by treatment after getting infected, however, the treatment expenditure is much higher than the prevention costs.</p> <p>You can prevent the spread of rabies by vaccinating your pets against rabies (which can be done from any public/private clinic or local health department). If you find that your pet is carrying scratches, bites or scars, the possible source of which is unknown, then you probably need to be more careful and take your pet to a local health department to get checked for rabies.</p> <p>Take care of the health of your pets and also check out for all the possible symptoms of rabies. If in case your pet bites a person, you need to take the necessary steps, such as providing proper vaccination and medical help to that person.</p> <p>Besides this, stray animals also need to be taken care of from the possible infection of rabies (as your pets can come in contact with stray animals). If there are stray animals in your area, you need to inform the local health department regarding this. Take care not to handle aggressive wild animals or those looking sick.</p> <p>Vaccines for humans are also available to prevent the possible infection of rabies. To reduce the risk of getting infected or bit by a rabid animal, it's better to get vaccinated first.</p> <p>Remember, prevention is better than cure!</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure. It's also understood as a condition that may be life-threatening for the common man.</p> <h3>About High Blood Pressure</h3> <p>High blood pressure or hypertension is the increase of blood pressure in the arteries. In a human being the normal level for systolic blood pressure is 100-140mmHg and for diastolic, it is 60-90mmHg. Any higher than these levels, the condition is known as hypertension. High blood pressure directly increases the risk of coronary heart disease (a condition that leads to heart attack), stroke, kidney failure, etc.</p> <h3>Managing Pressure</h3> <p>Firstly, try keeping your cool. Check your blood pressure regularly. Of the people who have high blood pressure, 32% don't even know they have it. Blood pressure tends to increase slightly with age, so it's a good idea to have your doctor check it at least once a year.</p> <h3>Reduce your Sodium Intake</h3> <p>Too much sodium, usually found in table salt can aggravate blood pressure by causing your body to retain excessive fluids. These fluids can make it harder for your heart to pump effectively and can irritate blood vessels that are already sensitive. You may also resort to climbing stairs if you like salt in your meals. Climbing stairs releases the sodium in sweat, negating any ill effects of its excessive intake.</p> <h3>Limit Cholesterol and Fat Intake</h3> <p>Too much dietary cholesterol and saturated fats can cause plaque to build up on the inner walls of blood vessels, thereby causing unnecessary strain to the heart. Limit your daily cholesterol to no more than 100 mg per 1,000 calories of food. As far as possible avoid red meat and other cholesterol laden items. You can have some homemade fats in moderation, up to a teaspoon of homemade dairy fat, but no more. Most people in their attempts to lose weight, cut down on fats totally, leaving your joints devoid of the natural greasing that they provide.</p> <h3>Some Additional Tips</h3> <p><i> Exercise regularly</i><br>Regular exercise of any form, from walking to weight training, if done religiously helps in lowering blood pressure as well as raises the levels of the HDL cholesterol (the kind that carries artery-clogging cholesterol out of your blood). Another good way of lowering your cholesterol would be climbing the stairs instead of taking the elevator.</p> <p>The calf muscles are endowed with what is known as a second heart that releases good cholesterol, during workouts. Just make sure that you consult with your physician before you start an exercise program and don't overdo it, especially in the beginning.</p> <h3>Stop Smoking</h3> <p>If you smoke, stop right now! Smoking raises your blood pressure and causes higher levels of bad cholesterol.</p> <h3>Take Your Medication</h3> <p>If your doctor prescribes medication, make sure you take it faithfully in addition to any dietary modifications and exercise program that was recommended. Too often, people take medication irregularly, with the belief that the symptoms have stopped and hence they are fit again.</p> <p>* As far as possible, don't avoid your morning walk. Taking walks in the early hours replenishes your body's oxygen levels. If you want a healthy heart and live longer, get your walking shoes and march out immediately. The soles of our feet represent the various pressure points for the organs in our body. Walking ensures that all these points are stimulated from time to time.<br></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Epilepsy is a rather scary condition characterized by convulsions, episodes of sudden and involuntary muscle contractions. These may involve frothing through the mouth in extreme cases.</p> <p>Epilepsy refers to a set of neurological disorders that are commonly manifested through seizures. It is the result of a disruption in the normal cell-to-cell communication process of the central nervous system. Seizures have the ability to raise a serious alarm if left untreated, causing havoc in a person's life.</p> <p>Although these episodes may be infrequent, it is important that the patient is made aware of the condition he faces when attack strikes. At most times, patients when left unaware, often find themselves at the mercy of others, without realizing that help is just at an arm's length.</p> <h3>How to deal with a Seizure</h3> <p>Sometimes, one cannot really monitor the frequency of a seizure. At most times patients have little or no control over their body parts. Some of them are even scared, thinking that they might be mugged when a seizure strikes. Most doctors recommend that the patient and his family members should be made aware of what he might do during an attack.</p> <p>Although only about 1 percent of the world is known to suffer from these seizures, the causes are yet under research, with a definite solution that still remains unearthed!</p> <h3>Causes and Effects</h3> <p>The physiological reason behind a seizure is altered communication between neurons. This may occur due to brain tumors and cancers, brain injury, alcohol or drug abuse, as well as certain bacterial and parasitic infections. Depending on the precise etiology, epileptic conditions have been categorized as:</p> <p><span>* Symptomatic epilepsy that involves pathologically evident damage to the brain tissue.</span><br /><br /><span>* Cryptogenic epilepsy that is characterized by symptoms suggestive of brain damage but no physical damage to the brain is detectable.</span><br /><br /><span>* Idiopathic epilepsy, for which the etiology is unclear.</span></p> <h3>Symptoms and Signs</h3> <p>The signs of seizures largely depend upon the type of seizure. Some of them may last for only 20 seconds whereas some might stretch for about 45 minutes to an hour. Since they are difficult to pinpoint, there is a generalized view on this.</p> <p>* Generalized seizures may affect the consciousness and bodily functions from its onset and affect the whole body.<br /><br /><span>* Absence seizures usually last 10 to 30 seconds. They may include slight movement, or a total loss of contact with the environment. Since the impulses to the brain are infrequent, it's a tough situation for the patient to even move his finger.</span></p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Epilepsy cannot be cured completely but can be controlled by treating the specific neurological disorder as well as by using anti-epileptic drugs (AED). However, certain precautions should be taken.</p> <p>* You could loosen some amount of restrictive clothing; roll over the patient to one side so that he breathes easily, without any blockages.<br /><br /><span>* You could move any sharp or potentially harmful items away from the person suffering from a seizure to ensure that he does not harm himself or others around him.</span></p> <p><i>Disclaimer: This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Peripheral artery disease afflicts at least 12 million Americans, causing unbearable pain due to leg arteries being clogged with plaque. Now there are two new treatments for PAD-a tiny plaque-shearing razor called the SilverHawk.</p> <p>By Carol Johnson</p> <p>When older patients go to the doctor complaining of pain while walking, often their pain is misdiagnosed as simply being a sign of aging. And many people assume that diagnosis without even going to the doctor. But leg pain could be a sign of a serious condition called peripheral artery disease, or PAD. When leg arteries stiffen and narrow because of plaque buildup inside, blood flow to muscles is diminished. That lack of blood causes an aching pain while walking, called claudication, and in severe cases patients can hobble only a block or two before the pain overtakes them.</p> <p>Because most patients don't seek help early, arteries can come completely blocked. PAD leads to about 150,000 amputations each year. But going without treatment can affect more than just mobility. PAD more than quadruples the risk of a heart attack or stroke. It naturally follows that if leg arteries are clogged, then other blood vessels must also be clogged.</p> <p>A treatment for clearing arteries in the heart, angioplasty has been used successfully for years. In angioplasty a tiny balloon is threaded inside the artery to push aside the plaque. But angioplasty is difficult to accomplish in the legs, because the metal stents used to hold arteries open don't work as well in leg arteries, where \"restenoisis\"-reblockage with scar tissue or new plaque-can occur quickly.</p> <p>Two new technologies have been offering hope to patients suffering from this hard-to-treat disease: <br />n<ul>n<li><i>Cryoplasty</i> is essentially an angioplasty procedure on ice. Instead of water, the doctor inflates the angioplasty balloon with freezing nitrous oxide, better known as laughing gas. The low temperature of the gas firms the plaque and makes it easier to push aside, while inhibiting cells in the artery wall from forming scar tissue. A study reported by Dr. John Laird of the Washington Hospital Center tracked 102 PAD patients who had been treated with cryoplasty. Almost three years after their procedure, nearly 75% of the patients needed no further treatment, and blood is still flowing well through treated areas.</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li>A tiny razor called the SilverHawk, only the size of a grain of rice, is threaded in a catheter through patients' arteries to the blockages. Then the blade emerges and begins shearing off ribbons of the yellowish sludge, with the device's tip collecting up the plaque to extract it. Dr. Roger Gammon of Austin, TX, announced last month the results of a registry tracking 335 patients for a year, and so far nearly 80% have needed no further treatment of the shaved-out areas.</li>n</ul></p> <p>The SilverHawk razor has even been credited with sparing some particularly serious patients from amputation they would certainly have had to have without the razor treatment. Although neither option has yet been directly compared to older, established treatments for PAD to see how long the effects will last, a PAD specialist at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center feels optimistic. Dr. William Gray says, \"Both of these devices are promising. The kicker is long-term durability.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. has entered into a $9 million contract with the manufacturer of the SilverHawk razor, FoxHollow Technologies, to buy some of the extracted plaque from PAD patients. The company plans to use the plaque to research how to keep arteries from clogging in the first place. If the collaboration between the two companies continues, it could generate up to $31 million more for research. Since some heart attack sufferers seem healthy right until their attack, it is essential for scientists to discover what causes different types of plaque to form, so they can develop better ways to prevent atherosclerosis whether it occurs in the arteries of the legs or of the heart.</p> <p>If Merck develops a promising pharmaceutical treatment for controlling plaque buildup, they will need test subjects to participate in clinical trials. The company may recruit SilverHawk patients for drug studies so they can analyze the plaque taken from one leg before taking a medication, and then analyze the plaque taken from the other leg after taking the medication, to see if the drug significantly affects plaque buildup. \"This is a real opportunity to advance the science of understanding plaque biology,\" says Dr. Richard Pasternak, Merck's vice president of clinical research.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Lung cancer has emerged as one of the most deadliest and dreadful killer in past few decades among both, men and women. Every year, around 2.7 to 3 million people lose their lives to this malignant disease.</p> <p>Lung cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in one or both the lungs. These cells do not carry out the functions of the normal lung cells, and do not develop into healthy tissue. As they continue to grow, they form tumors, and interfere with the functioning of the lung. Research has discovered that it takes a series of mutations to create a lung cancer cell. Initially, a cell may be benign, i.e., it may still function normally in spite of having mutations. But, when it gets divided, it passes its abnormalities to two cells. These get further divided into four, and consequently, there are a huge number of abnormal cells, which form malignant tumors, giving rise to cancer.</p> <p><b>Types</b></p> <p>This disease is divides into two common types:n<ul>n<li>Small Cell - It is not the one found in most cases, it takes the second position. Here, the infection starts at a very small level inside the breathing tube (large breathing tube of our respiratory system) in the form of infection and growth of small round cells, it mutates and grows very fast at rapid pace, which leads to problems in breathing process. It is believed to be mainly caused due to smoking.</li>n<li>Non-small Cell - It is very common, and found in most of the cases. It affects other parts of the lung, and the time taken by it to develop completely differs from the other type. Its main subtypes are Squamous Cell Carcinoma (found in a bronchus near the center of lung), Adenocarcenoma (caused due to mucus-producing cells), and Large Cell Carcinoma.</li>n</ul>n<b>Causes</b>n<ul>n<li>Cigarette-smoking stands at the number one position among the causes. It is estimated to have taken about 80-85% of the lives of those who suffer from this disease.</li>n<li>Exposure to substances, such as asbestos, which come from the industrial area is the other major reason.</li>n<li>Besides this, passive smoking, abuse of chemical elements, genetic disorders, etc., are also considered as possible causes.</li>n</ul>n<b>Symptoms</b>n<ul>n<li>Wheezing and coughing are the primary symptoms, which are sometimes is accompanied by a small quantity of blood.</li>n<li>At times, due to the blood secretion through the internal part (affected tissues/cells) of the lung, the affected person's mucus can contain blood stains.</li>n<li>It is also accompanied by weight loss, cyanosis (change in color of skin due to the less supply of oxygen), and back-ache.</li>n<li>The patient may feel extremely tired, have pain in the chest, as well swelling of arms and legs.</li>n<li>As the time passes by, the patient finds it difficult to breathe (shortness of breath, which is also called Dyspnea).</li>n</ul>n<b>Diagnosis</b></p> <p>The carcinogens, which are found in tobacco and substances like asbestos, damage the cells on the internal lining of bronchi and other sensitive areas of the respiratory systems, such as air passages. The tissues that are infected are damaged, and they slowly start taking shape of tumors. In some cases, these carcinogen substances do not show their effect altogether for few years to a couple of decades on the tissues/cells, after initial exposure, which makes it hard to detect and substantially reduces the possibility of survival of the patient.</p> <p>If you think that you might have contracted the disease, then the first advice for you would be to find a good physician, and get yourself diagnosed for it. There are many diagnostic tests available, which can help you find out if you are really infected. The tests include a CT scan, CAT scan, Chest X-Ray, and Sputum Culture Testing.</p> <p><b>Stages</b></p> <p>The cancer is staged in five stages depending upon its progression and the probability of the patient's survival.n<ol>n<li>Stage 0 indicates that the cancer has just infected, but has not yet started spreading and can be controlled. The Stage 0 length can be up to 5 years, and the patient's survival rates are about 75-85%.</li>n<li>Stage I indicates that the tumor is inside the lung, but has not yet matured and started spreading. The survival rate for the same is about 50%.</li>n<li>Stage II indicates that the disease has started spreading, survival rates for patient are very low, about 25-30%.</li>n<li>Stage III indicates that the tumor has matured and has spread across every region around the chest and all the blood vessels. Survival rates are only 10-15%.</li>n<li>Stage IV indicates that the disease has rapidly spread everywhere in the body, and the survival rates are not more than 1-2%.</li>n</ol>n<b>Treatment</b></p> <p>The severity and treatment success rate highly depend on the direction in which the disease is spreading. If the tumor is growing inwards or if the tumor has a mutating capability, then it really becomes very hard to detect the condition in its early stage. The spreading of the damaged/infected tissues all over the body through blood (a condition, which is called metastasis) makes the condition worst for the patient, as it stands a very high possibility of multiple-cancer situation. The treatment depends on the stage of the disorder, and the physical and medical history of the patient. The options primarily include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.</p> <p><b>Preventive Measures</b><ul><li>Try to avoid both, active and passive smoking.</li><li>Try to avoid junk food, include as much vegetables as possible in your daily diet.</li><li>Try to avoid the contact of industrial substances, such as asbestos, coal gas, etc.</li><li>Take vitamins daily.</li><li>Reduce alcohol consumption.</li></ul><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Nerve transplants offer many advantages over amputation, the most obvious one being the aesthetic aspect. The following article explains this relatively unheard of medical procedure, in brief.</p> <p><em>By Lana Christian</em><br /><br />Although nerve transplants have been performed since the late 1980s, the surgery is still a well-kept secret. Because of this, the general public doesn't know to ask for it, but it could be a viable alternative to amputation.</p> <p>When you hear the word \"transplant,\" the mental image conjured is usually that of a heart or kidney transplant. Put it in; sew it up; give the person immunosuppressive drugs for life ... and, if all goes well, everything functions as it should. Nerve transplants work very differently.</p> <p>Nerves don't function on their own when they're transplanted. Instead, they serve as a framework or \"guide wire\", onto which the patient's own nerve cells eventually grow. The physician has to set up connections so that new nerves can grow along the right pathways. But that growth doesn't happen quickly. Nerves grow about an inch a month. So patients need to expect a long rehabilitation - up to two years, depending on which nerves were severed due to injury. So, if the site for a nerve transplant is the forearm, a person's recovery may proceed like this: first, regain feeling in fingertips; regain the ability to distinguish hot and cold in various places on the arm; regain hand dexterity; and at last, regain ability to bend/move/use the entire forearm.</p> <p>Nerve transplants offer many advantages over amputation. The most obvious benefit is the aesthetic aspect. In addition, if healthy nerves can be grafted from other sites on the patient (called an autograft), no immunosuppressive drugs are needed. If a patient needs to have nerves donated, immunosuppressive drugs are given only until the patient's nerves grow back. </p> <p>As with anything, nerve transplants have some drawbacks. Timing is critical. The optimal time to do this is three months after the injury. People need to be able to find and consult with a specialist who can schedule this within that time frame. Another drawback is that you can't know with certainty how much functionality will return. Reason: The body is busy with many things after a nerve transplant. Besides growing the nerves themselves, it is re-establishing pathways to and from the brain, that tell the body what to do and how to do it (like bend the arm, and so on). The success of that \"rewiring\" depends on rehabilitation and sheer persistence, as the body creates new pathways for carrying nerve signals.</p> <p>Nerve transplants are being done on our soldiers in Iraq. Their protective gear leaves their arms and legs exposed (so they can maneuver and run) - which is creating what one officer calls \"a war of the extremities.\" A soldier who suffers a blunt injury to an isolated spot of the nerve is a good candidate for this type of surgery. Closer to home, nerve transplantation made CNN headlines when a teenager was severely injured in a motorcycle accident. His injuries were too extensive for doctors to attempt autografts, so they tissue typed his family. His mother was the closest match. Her son received nerve transplants from both her legs and arms. Instead of losing an arm and a leg, today he has both. As he continues his rehabilitation, he is learning to walk again.</p> <p>Supply and demand will drive the need for more physicians to be trained in this highly specialized surgical procedure. As Dr. Allen Belzberg of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine bluntly puts it, \"We need to get the word out there - don't go lopping things off until you check with us.\"</p>"

If anyone from your family had skin cancer, then you are at a higher risk of acquiring the disease.</li>n</ul></p> <h2>Treatment</h2> <h3>Surgery</h3> <p>Surgery for skin cancer involves cutting the skin area which is affected. Surgery can be most effective if the affected area is cut from the skin in the early stages of skin cancer.</p> <h3>Curettage And Electrodessication</h3> <p>An instrument called curettage is used to remove the cancer affected area. An electric machine is used to pass current in and around the affected area that stops blood circulation to and from the affected area, which is called electrodessication.</p> <h3>Moh's Surgery</h3> <p>This type of surgery is used when the doctor is not very sure about the area, depth and nature of the skin cancer. Moh's Surgery is very complex in nature and is more effective when the tumor is bigger in size and the affected area is hard to treat. In this surgery, tissue layers are removed based on the microscopic study of the tissues in and around the affected area.</p> <h3>Cryosurgery</h3> <p>In this type of treatment, the affected area is cooled to a very low temperature. The affected tissues/cells are frozen and killed with the help of liquid nitrogen. Depending upon the complexity and the affected area, this treatment can be repeated a number of times.</p> <h3>Laser Therapy</h3> <p>A high intensity narrow beam of laser is used to destroy the cells in the affected area. This therapy is used in most cases wherein the cancer has not reached deeper inside the skin.</p> <p>Along with the above mentioned therapies, <b>Radiation and Chemotherapy</b> are the most commonly used treatments.</p> <h2>What Should I lookout For?</h2> <p>Skin cancer begins with very small, light-colored lumps on the skin. Sometimes the lump can also appear dry and be reddish or dark in color, these lumps are rough in nature. Any such lump can serve as a clue of skin cancer. The melanoma matures into a large mole which spreads across a large area and as it progresses, the cancer appears as if it is leaking blood. If you experience such moles or lumps on your skin, witness any suspicious change, and have non-healing sores, consult your doctor.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Each year, more than 500 people around the world lose their lives to some or other type of allergies. Let's learn about food allergy and its common symptoms in order to be well aware of it.</p> <p>Allergy is a condition which results when our body's immune system fails in differentiating harmful and harmless substances. As a consequence, it reacts against potentially harmless substances leading to an uncomfortable health condition. Antibodies like IgE are specifically associated with allergic reactions. In this article we will learn about one of the most common types of allergy called food allergy.</p> <p>At least 2-3% of the world's population suffers from some kind of food allergy. In the United States, a large population (as large as 15 million) is prone to food allergies. According to the report of the National Institutes of Health Expert Panel on Food Allergy Research (in the US), an estimated total of 9 million of adults suffer from food allergies, whereas this number amounts to around 6 million in children. The young population is affected more severely.</p> <h3>What is Food Allergy</h3> <p>As mentioned above, some specific food substance causes adverse reactions in our body and it is termed as allergy. Our immune system starts showing an abnormal response and fails to recognize the harmless food substance. It interprets the substance's existence in our body in similar fashion as it interprets the existence of virus, bacteria or any other foreign substance and starts taking action against the harmless substance.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>As food allergy or hypersensitivity is caused due to the immune system, most of the symptoms include reactions related to our nervous system. Some of the symptoms are as given below:n<ul>n<li>People might start vomiting after eating the food that causes allergy to their body.</li>n<li>The reaction might lead to a sudden rise of itchy hives on the skin, making the patient irritatingly scratch the skin.</li>n<li>The reaction also may lead to swelling in different organs of the body. The organs may also get damaged, worsening the situation further.</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li>Some people experience problems related to respiratory and digestive systems.</li>n<li>Along with the above-mentioned symptoms, people also experience nausea, cough, wheezing, diarrhea, metallic taste and problems with the throat, and stomach problems.</li>n<li>If the condition is more serious, people may experience anaphylactic reaction of varying intensity (which can be very mild to life-threatening) in their bodies in or across the various organs. The anaphylactic reaction is a very severe and sudden reaction in which multiple problems may occur which include all the above-mentioned symptoms along with low blood pressure, breathing problem, etc.</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Common Substances Causing Food Allergy</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Milk</li>n<li>Peanuts</li>n<li>Tree nuts</li>n<li>Fish</li>n<li>Lobster</li>n<li>Crab</li>n<li>Egg</li>n<li>Soy</li>n<li>Wheat</li>n<li>Shrimp</li>n<li>Shellfish</li>n</ul>n<span>Although, any type of food can cause allergy in people, generally foods like fish, crab, lobsters, various types of tree nuts, and shellfish, etc. cause allergies in adults. On the other hand, egg, soy, milk, peanuts, etc., are common causes of allergies in children.</span></p> <h3>How to Find Out if You Have Food Allergy</h3> <p>After eating some food, if you experience any of the symptoms enlisted above, then you should first check if you have food allergy. Sometimes it might happen that something you eat may contain more than one type of food, which might lead to confusion in deciding which food you are allergic to. In this case, you should be careful enough not to eat any of the ingredients that you had eaten earlier, and should avoid eating anything till you don't consult a good physician.</p> <h3>Tests and Treatment Options</h3> <p>Your doctor might ask you about the various symptoms that you have experienced and also may inquire about the food that you had eaten. Your doctor may also ask you about your history of allergies or symptoms that you might have experienced previously.</p> <p>Your doctor may decide to go for some diagnostic tests like skin test, blood test or even try to test the allergic reaction by making you eat very small quantity of the food you had consumed. These diagnostic tests can uncover the allergic condition and the food you are allergic to.</p> <p>Based on the results of diagnostic tests, your doctor might prescribe you certain medications or suggest you some schedule that you need to follow in order to avoid any more complications of food allergy.</p> <p>Besides following the medication, you also need to be very careful about what you eat. You should never take a chance with the food you are allergic to. Remember, your body might only show mild reactions to the food you are allergic to, but it also can lead to a very severe condition such as failure of organs, unconsciousness or death.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_name": "surgery-medicine-face-transplant",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>So far only partial face transplants have been done, but a full transplant is very likely to be possible in the near future.</p> <p>Your face is one of the main things that identifies you. It helps you to express yourself in a myriad of different ways, and influences to a large extent the way you relate to the world. With a different face, your experiences would no doubt be different. It is something we take for granted mostly, but what would you do if you lost your face? Unthinkable as the notion is, this kind of tragedy has indeed befallen on quite a few people, either from disease or accident. So far, in these cases, skin grafts taken from other parts of the patient's body are used and it takes several operations to reconstruct the entire face in this manner. The end result, since the important nerves that control expressions are missing, is often mask-like. Not unnaturally, this can bring on several psychological problems with the patient finding it difficult to adjust in a regular social environment. The innovations in medical science now offer some measure of hope for these people so they can lead a relatively normal life. Face Transplant, which involves grafting the skin, including the nerves and muscles of a donor, onto a patient's face, and which would allow a greater degree of facial movement, is now a reality.</p> <p>Face Transplant is done using Microsurgical Procedure. The face skin of a brain dead, live donor, along with blood vessels, veins, and arteries, is grafted onto the face of the patient, whose own damaged skin, underlying nerves, and fat have been removed in preparation for the graft. There are a lot of risks involved in the procedure and the chances are high that the body may reject the new skin or that an infection may set in. The patient has to take expensive immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of his or her life and may also need to undergo extensive psychological counseling, to cope with the task of living with a new face. A Consultant Plastic Surgeon at London's Royal Free Hospital, Dr. Peter Butler, has received permission from the NHS Ethics Board to carry out full transplant surgeries.</p> <p>One of the successful transplants carried out in recent times was on a 38-year-old Frenchwoman named Isabelle Dinoire, whose face had been extensively damaged in an attack by her pet dog. After numerous counseling sessions, Ms. Dinoire underwent partial surgery in Amiens, under Professor Jean Michel Dubernard and Professor Bernard Devauchelle. Her nose, mouth, and chin were successfully reconstructed and, while she will have to take immunosuppressive drugs for her entire life, she is so far doing fine according to her doctors.</p> <p>Although popular movies like Face Off, for example, denote otherwise, getting a transplant will not make a patient look exactly like the donor. This is because of the fact that only the skin of the donor is grafted onto the patient. The underlying bones and muscles, as well as the expressions which make a face unique, remain those of the patient. So, there is no question of a resemblance to the donor. However, the patient will not look like he or she did before the disfigurement either.</p> <p>Even so, when asked, many people, and this includes those in the medical profession, show a distinct disinclination about donating their faces after their deaths. It is after all an entirely different matter from donating other body organs like kidneys or eyes.</p> <p>Medical ethicists also question if the risks involved are worth the procedure. In case the surgery fails, then where does that leave the patient? Many people, who have suffered serious disfiguration, have also expressed deep doubts and reservations about undergoing a full transplant. Aside from the surgery, its after-effects, and the possibilities of failure, the idea of 'wearing someone else's face' is deeply disturbing.</p> <p>However, for others, it could mean a lessening of the daily trauma, a possibility of returning to a modicum of normalcy, and having gained a new lease of life.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Leaky gut syndrome is a commonly observed disorder of gastrointestinal tract. As the name states leaky gut is characterized by high permeability of the intestinal lining, thus causing disruption of filtration and immune mechanism.</p> <p>Leaky gut syndrome is characterized by increased permeability of intestines due damage of the intestinal lining. To understand leaky gut syndrome, it is of utmost importance that we should take a look at the physiology of our gastrointestinal tract (GI).</p> <h3>Physiology of Gastrointestinal Tract</h3> <p>In healthy conditions, GI tract absorbs and transmits molecules that are by-products of digestion process. These molecules can be of amino acids, sugar, vitamins, fatty acids, or minerals which are required by the body for proper functioning of life process. GI tract has a barrier in form of its intestinal lining.</p> <p>The transmission process across this lining is carried out in two ways depending on the size of these molecules. Small molecules (size up to 5000 Daltons) are transmitted across the intestinal lining with help of carrier proteins, a specific type of proteins present in intestine. This carrier protein gets bound with the small molecules of minerals, vitamins, and transmits them across the epithelium by active mechanism of transmission.</p> <p>Larger molecules (size more than 5000 Daltons up to 9200daltons) are transferred by means of passive mechanism. This passive mechanism uses the intercellular pathways or spaces commonly known as <I>Desmosomes</I>. Desmosomes are tight junction spaces present in between epithelium cells which don't allow the larger molecules of unwanted material to cross the lining. Infections, autoimmune diseases and certain gastrointestinal disorders alter the structural integrity of the intestinal lining. This disrupts intestinal permeability, and leaky gut syndrome occurs.</p> <h3>Inflammation of Gastrointestinal Tract</h3> <p>Due to varied reasons GI tract gets inflamed and it fails to absorb nutrients and foods properly in the blood stream. Fatigue and bloating are the common symptoms visible. As the permeability function of intestine gets disrupted, it allows larger food particles to pass through along with antibodies in blood stream. It results in food allergies and new symptoms. The carrier proteins get damaged which results in nutrient deficiency. Due to the malfunctioning of detoxification pathways chemical sensitivity poses a problem which leads to the alarming level of toxins and overburdens the liver.</p> <p>In addition, the intestinal lining is the site for secretion of immunoglobulin A, which is essential for protection from several infectious agents. This function of the intestinal lining gets altered due to inflammation and tissue damage, leading to an increase in susceptibility to infections.</p> <p>Leaky gut syndrome also leads to frequent triggering of the immune system, which adds to the complications. When the intestinal epithelial lining becomes more permeable, even larger substances like toxins, undigested food particles, disease-causing bacteria pass directly through the damaged cells. The immune mechanism is alarmed, and <i>cytokines</i> are secreted, which stimulate white blood corpuscles to fight the foreign particles. The immune reaction thus triggered, causes irritation and inflammation throughout the body.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Symptoms of intestinal permeability include the following:n<ul>n<li>Asthma</li>n<li>Abdominal pain</li>n<li>Indigestion</li>n<li>Chronic joint pain</li>n<li>Chronic muscle pain</li>n<li>Poor immunity</li>n<li>Foggy thinking</li>n<li>Confusion</li>n<li>Gas</li>n<li>Mood swings</li>n<li>Nervousness</li>n</ul></p> <p>This condition also gives rise to other health problems like:n<ul>n<li>Poor memory</li>n<li>Anxiety</li>n<li>Fatigue</li>n<li>Recurrent vaginal infections</li>n<li>Skin rashes</li>n<li>Diarrhea</li>n<li>Bed-wetting</li>n<li>Recurrent bladder infections</li>n<li>Constipation</li>n<li>Shortness of breath</li>n<li>Bloating</li>n<li>Aggressive behavior</li>n<li>Feeling toxic</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>It has been hypothesized that intestinal infections may be a major cause for occurrence of leaky gut syndrome. If an accelerated growth of bacteria in small intestine occurs, it can prove to be fatal. Environmental contaminants like toxic metals are also one of the major causes of disease. In addition, chronic stress and side effects of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs contribute towards the syndrome.</p> <p>This syndrome has also been associated with numerous other diseases including autoimmune diseases, hives, pancreatic insufficiency, arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, liver dysfunction, food allergies and sensitivities, irritable bowel syndrome, etc.</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>\"Mannitol and lactulose tests\" are the principal tool of diagnosis. Both being water-soluble molecules that body can't use; mannitol is the one which can be absorbed by healthy intestine while lactulose is a larger molecule and cannot be absorbed by intestinal lining. This tests aims at finding out the amount of absorption of these two molecules by means of urinalysis after six hours.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Altered intestinal permeability remains the principal cause and thankfully there are numerous nutrients and herbs are present, that help to reduce inflammation of gut. Stress reduction therapies can be very effective in the treatment. It is essential to restore the healthy ecology of gut.</p> <p><ul>n<li>Nutrients like glutamine (amino acid), which is essential for production of intestinal mucus, Vitamin A for production of antibodies, Zinc for growth and healing of epithelial cells play a major role in treatment.</li>n<li>Herbs like Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice, Silymarin or milk thistle, Aloe, Slippery Elm are used more commonly to heal the damaged lining of intestinal wall.</li>n<li>Stress reduction therapy offers much more relief as there is a strong connection between brain and activities of digestive system.</li>n</ul></p> <p>The leaky gut syndrome is a proposed theory to explain a damaged bowel lining. However, it is not a widely recognized diagnosis and is based mainly on alternative medicine hypothesis. Therefore, before coming to any conclusion, make sure you speak to expert doctors for more advice.</p> <p><i>Disclaimer: This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Trisomy 13 syndrome, also known as Patau syndrome, is a congenital chromosomal abnormality. It occurs due to the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 13. Read on for some more facts about this disorder.</p> <p>Patau syndrome is a very rare and one of the most severe autosomal trisomies. Around 1960, it was identified as a cytogenetic syndrome (<i>a chromosomal or genetic disease</i>). The cause of this syndrome is the abnormal presence of an extra copy of chromosome 13. There is normally a pair of each chromosome in the human body. In the case of trisomies (<i>tri</i>: three, <i>soma</i>: body), one more copy of the chromosome is present in the structure. The extra chromosome 13 disturbs the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features related to each autosomal trisomy. Chronic mental deficiency is a characteristic invariably found in children born with Patau syndrome, along with several structural abnormalities. It is generally diagnosed at the time of birth, by the presence of congenital structural defects and poor neurological performance. The probability of a child being born with Patau syndrome is around 1 in 10,000.</p> <p>\u25ba <b>Physiology and Pathology</b><br>Patau syndrome is caused by the extra chromosome 13. In most cases, each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 13 instead of the usual two. There is also a probability of only a few of the body's cells having an extra copy of chromosome 13, rather than all. Such cases are known as Mosaic Patau. The severity of the physical symptoms in the case of Mosaic Patau depends upon the number of cells affected.</p> <p>This syndrome can also occur when part of chromosome 13 is translocated to another chromosome. The victim may have two copies of chromosome 13, plus extra material from chromosome 13 attached to another chromosome. This is called partial trisomy 13. The physical symptoms in this case vary from those of trisomy 13.</p> <p>Patau syndrome - complete or mosaic - isn't inherited, but occurs due to abnormal cell division during the process of the formation of reproductive cells in the fetus. During meiosis, non-disjunction of chromosomes results in the production of reproductive cells carrying additional number of chromosomes. For example, an ovum or sperm cell may get an extra chromosome attached to the original pair of chromosome 13. If any of these abnormal reproductive cells play a role in the genetic makeup of the fetus then the child will carry an extra number of chromosomes 13 in each of its body cells. </p> <p>However, Patau syndrome caused by translocation of chromosomal matter has a very high chance of being passed along to the next generation.</p> <p>\u25ba <b>Symptoms</b><br>Newborns with Patau syndrome score low on the Apgar test. They may have any combination of symptoms such as polydactyly (more than ten digits), cleft lip, cleft palate, rocker-bottom feet, cutis aplasia (lack of epidermis on scalp) etc. Conditions such as patent ductus arteriosus, dextrocardia, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect etc. are also commonly found. Holoprosencephaly, in which the brain is not divided into halves, is often present and is marked by the presence of midline facial defects like hypotelorism and microphthalmia. The nose may be underdeveloped or absent altogether.</p> <p>\u25ba <b>Prognosis</b><br>Average survival period for newborns suffering from Patau syndrome is 2.5 days. Less than 20% patients live more than a year. Reports of adults with Patau syndrome are rare.</p> <p>Holoprosencephaly is characterized by chronic neurological impairment and disruption of the development of the structural features of the face. It is also associated with cardiac anomalies. Studies have shown that an overwhelming 83% of deaths occur due to cardiac arrest or congenital heart diseases. Survivors suffer from severe mental retardation and delayed development.</p> <p>\u25ba <b>Diagnosis</b><br>1. Gastrointestinal X-ray examination or ultrasound can reveal abnormalities in the internal organs.<br>2. MRI or CT scans can reveal the fused cerebral hemispheres.<br>3. Chromosomal studies show trisomy or translocation.</p> <p>\u25ba <b>Treatment</b><br>Chromosomal disorders can't be diagnosed as easily as acquired diseases, and no foolproof countermeasure exists against them. There is no way of knowing exactly when or why the 13th chromosome will produce an abnormal third copy, making prevention virtually impossible. Surgical treatments are suspended for the first few months because of the high mortality rate of babies associated with Patau syndrome. Physicians plan treatment on a case-to-case basis, but Patau syndrome patients surviving infancy is more of a case of good luck than a triumph for the science of medicine. </p> <p>The sad fact is that as of now, there's no cure for trisomy 13 and there can't be any guarantee of a prolonged life for the unfortunate ones afflicted by it.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome is a genetic disorder. This severe condition is caused due to the presence of an extra copy of the 18th chromosome in every cell of the body.</p> <p>Trisomy 18 is relatively common compared to Patau syndrome. Its occurrence probability ratio is 1:3000. As John H. Edward first recorded its details in 1960, this genetic disorder was named after him as 'Edwards syndrome'. The occurrence percentage is more in girls compared to boys, which is about 3 times higher.</p> <h3>Physiology and Pathology</h3> <p>There are 23 pairs of chromosomes present in all the cells of the human body. During fertilization a normal cell of sperm or ova carry 23 chromosomes each; one of each contributes to make 23 pairs of chromosomes. Thus, a cell of a healthy fertilized egg carries 23 pairs or 46 chromosomes. However, in this condition, due to some errors at the time of two meiotic cell divisions, proper segregation of the chromosomes doesn't occur. This process is known as non-disjunction, which gives rise to abnormality in chromosome numbers.</p> <p>In trisomy, there is an extra copy of the chromosome attached to the normal chromosome in the egg cell, making the haploid number 24 instead of 23. Fertilization of such eggs results in trisomy, which means three copies of a chromosome instead of two. This additional chromosome gets attached with the chromosome 18, resulting in abnormality.</p> <p>This syndrome affects all the organs of the body. It is characterized by distinct impaired facial features. It can affect individuals from all ethnic backgrounds. About 95% cases get aborted in embryonic or fetal stages, or before birth.</p> <p>The abnormal characteristic of individuals affected by this syndrome is due to extra genetic coding because of the third chromosome. As initial single cell of egg carries this extra copy of chromosome, each and every cell of the body contains the same extra genetic coding. This hampers the child's ability to grow and develop. The physical abilities of the child gets impaired permanently. The characteristic physical abnormalities that follow the onset of Edwards syndrome include small or abnormally shaped head, low body weight at the time of birth, small jaws or mouth, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, heart defects, etc.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>It adversely affects all organ systems of the human body. Its symptoms include:n<ol>n<li>Nervous system and brain - It severely affects the central nervous system and brain. Mental retardation and delayed brain developments are the common brain malfunctions. High muscle tone, physical malformation, and seizures can also occur.</li>n<li>Head and face - It is characterized by distinct facial abnormalities. Microganthia (abnormally small jaws), microcephaly (small head), low set ears, epicanthal folds, wide-set eyes, small eyes, small mouth, upturned nose, prominent back portion of head, and palpebral fissures (narrow eyelid folds ) are some of the common symptoms.</li>n<li>Heart - 90% of the patients are affected by congenital heart defects. Ventricular septal defect, atricular septal defect, coronary valve defect, and patent ductus arteriosus may also develop.</li>n<li>Bones - Clenched fists with 2nd and 5th fingers overlapped on others, severe growth retardation, rocker bottom feet, webbing, absent radius, and shortened nails are some of the symptoms of this condition.</li>n<li>Malfunctioning and malformations of the digestive tract, reproductive system, and urinary tract are also found.</li>n</ol></p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>MRI, ultrasound, CT scan, X-ray, and genetic testing before birth can detect this condition. Ultrasound and MRI can detect the abnormalities in the fetus. Genetic testing by means of amniocentesis can confirm its occurrence. CT scans and X-rays can confirm the abnormalities in the brain and skeletal system respectively. After birth blood test can confirm the presence of this condition. Even the visible features of facial impairment or bone abnormalities can help in the diagnosis.</p> <h3>Prognosis</h3> <p>More than 50% of the affected infants do not survive beyond 5 to 6 days. Those who do survive are not able to reach their first birthday. Very rarely infants have survived to teenage. Moreover, they were affected by severe physical deformity.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Due to the nature of this condition, life sustaining measures are not recommended. The medical treatment for individuals who are affected by this condition is always focused on treating infections, heart problems, and providing nutrition. Due to its complex, multifaceted nature only 5% infants survive up to 1 year of age.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Shingles is a condition that is caused by the Varicella-Zoster Virus, which is also the causal agent for chickenpox. The following article provides information on this viral disease.</p> <p><div>n<div><strong>Bare Facts</strong></div>nThe United States reports nearly 1 million cases of shingles annually, and it is believed that 1 in 3 Americans go on to develop this condition at least once in their lifetime.</div>n<br>Shingles, which is also known as herpes zoster, is a medical condition characterized by the development of painful blisters on the skin. It is caused by the '<span>Varicella-zoster Virus</span>' (VZV), which is the virus that is responsible for causing chickenpox in humans.<br><br>When a person suffers from chickenpox during childhood, the VZV remains in the body lifelong even after the individual has fully recovered from chickenpox. The virus lies in a dormant form, until it gets reactivated. When it does, one is affected by shingles, and not chickenpox. For this reason, herpes zoster is also referred to as the revisiting chickenpox disease. The virus is likely to get reactivated if the person is under constant stress, or has a compromised immune system. While most of the symptoms of this condition are flu-like, there are some characteristic symptoms which help in the diagnosis of this condition.<br><br>n<div><strong>Symptoms</strong><br><br>The symptoms arise when the virus travels up the nerve roots that supply sensation to the skin on one side of the body, thereby causing inflammation. The main symptom is the development of small painful blisters on the individual's skin, lined up like a strip or band, along the path of the nerve branch, or the area of skin supplied by those specific nerve roots. It is this distinctive symptom that usually helps the doctors to diagnose this condition. These blisters break and form small sores, which begin to dry and eventually form crusts. Later, the scabs crust in 2 to 3 weeks.<br><br><span>A few other symptoms include:</span><br><span>\u21aa</span> Tingling sensation<br><span>\u21aa</span> Fever and chills<br><span>\u21aa</span> Sensitivity<br><span>\u21aa</span> Itching<br><span>\u21aa</span> Joint pain<br><span>\u21aa</span> Malaise<br><span>\u21aa</span> Headaches<br><span>\u21aa</span> Swollen glands (lymph nodes)</div>n<br>n<div><strong>Complications that might arise if medical help is delayed:</strong><br><br>The treatment involves the use of antiviral drugs for alleviating the symptoms and speeding up the recovery process. Timely medical assistance is also required to lower the risk of a complication called neuralgia, which develops when herpes zoster reaches the advanced stage. In order to avoid this, one has to be watchful and consult a physician the moment the symptoms are suspected. You should also seek a physician's help if you continue to experience pain even after the rash has disappeared. If ignored, the condition can further worsen and lead to 'postherpetic neuralgia' - a condition characterized by unbearable pain.<br><br>If not treated in time, it can lead to severe health problems like:<br><br><span>\u21aa</span> Loss of eyesight<br><span>\u21aa</span> Pneumonia<br><span>\u21aa</span> Malfunctioning of some organs<br><span>\u21aa</span> Hearing problems<br><span>\u21aa</span> Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain due to a virus)</div>n<br>n<div><strong>Is shingles contagious?</strong><br><br>The VZV virus that causes chickenpox and herpes zoster can spread when a healthy person comes in direct contact with the open wounds/rashes/blisters of an individual suffering from this disease. It must be noted that when the virus spreads to a person who has never had chickenpox in his entire life, it would cause chickenpox and not herpes zoster. Shingles affects only those who have had chickenpox earlier. It occurs when the dormant virus gets reactivated. The risk of transmission is high during the phase when the patient has developed blisters that have clear fluid, but the rash covering the blisters is yet to develop crusts. Simply put, the virus can be transmitted till the blisters have dried and formed crusts.<br><br>The risk of transmission is higher in case of people with a weak immune system, small children, or pregnant women, when compared to healthy individuals. However, it would be best to avoid any contact with an individual who is affected by this disease.</div>n<br>n<div><strong>The virus can get reactivated if ...</strong><br><br>... an individual is in his old age, above 50 years.<br><br>... a person is suffering from a disease that weakens the immune system (AIDS and cancer).<br><br>... a person is taking immunosuppressive drugs.<br><br><strong>Take a Note:</strong>n<ul>n<li>The risk of transmission is high during the phase when blisters have developed, but the crusts are yet to form. Therefore, it is better to cover these blisters during this phase.</li>n<li>You need to strictly follow the guidelines given by the doctor.</li>n<li>You should avoid exposure to sunlight. Stay in a cool and dry room.</li>n<li>Avoid scratching the area that is affected by rash.</li>n</ul>n</div>n<br>Some individuals have reported pain without having any antecedent rashes. This is a very rare condition called <span>zoster sine herpete</span> (ZSH).

The following write-up provides information on the causes and symptoms of this condition, and ways to manage and prevent this life-threatening event.</p> <p>The state of unconsciousness that is induced by dangerously high or low levels of blood sugar is referred to as diabetic coma. This condition is often observed in diabetics who develop severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Though diabetic coma is a reversible form of coma, note that it is referred to as a medical emergency. It could be fatal if medical assistance is not sought on time.</p> <h2>Causative Factors</h2> <p>While severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis usually affect those who suffer from type 1 diabetes, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is more common in people who suffer from type 2 diabetes. The symptoms that the affected individual may experience before he/she passes out would vary, depending on the underlying cause.</p> <h3>Severe Hypoglycemia</h3> <p>Hypoglycemia is a medical condition that occurs when blood sugar levels become less than 70 mg/dL. When the blood sugar levels continue to fall, and become less than 55 mg/dL, the brain doesn't get enough glucose. The insufficient supply of glucose to the brain (neuroglycopenia) impairs brain function. The impairment of the cognitive function causes confusion and slowing of the reflexes. Under such circumstances, the affected individual may not be able to recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar. If he/she fails to take the necessary steps to normalize the blood sugar levels, he/she may lose consciousness.</p> <p>Those who have low blood sugar are likely to experience symptoms such as:<br>\u00bb Nervousness<br>\u00bb Sweating<br>\u00bb Confusion<br>\u00bb Anxiety<br>\u00bb Fatigue<br>\u00bb Lightheadedness<br>\u00bb Intense hunger<br>\u00bb Palpitations<br>\u00bb Abdominal discomfort</p> <h3>Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State</h3> <p>A person is said to suffer from hyperglycemia when the blood sugar levels become higher than 180 mg/dL. The increase in blood glucose levels causes the osmotic pressure of blood to increase. Under such circumstances, water may be drawn out from the tissues. This may cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. If a person is experiencing dehydration and has severe hyperglycemia (blood sugar is more than 600 mg/dL), he/she is likely to suffer from diabetic coma. This condition is also called nonketotic hyperosmolar coma.</p> <p>When high blood sugar levels lead to a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, the affected individual is likely to experience symptoms such as:<br>\u00bb Dehydration<br>\u00bb Dry mouth<br>\u00bb Electrolyte imbalance<br>\u00bb Lethargy<br>\u00bb Confusion<br>\u00bb Excessive thirst<br>\u00bb Increased urination<br>\u00bb Weakness on one side of the body</p> <h3>Diabetic Ketoacidosis</h3> <p>This condition occurs due to the body's inability to produce sufficient amounts of insulin. Under such circumstances, the body burns down fat for energy. Ketones are organic compounds that are produced in this process. Ketoacidosis refers to the high levels of ketone bodies in blood and urine. If the patient is experiencing physical fatigue and dehydration along with severe hyperglycemia, it can lead to advanced diabetic ketoacidosis. If left untreated, the patient may become comatose. This condition can be reversed if treatment is administered soon.</p> <p>When high blood sugar levels lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, the affected individual is likely to experience symptoms such as:<br>\u00bb Increased thirst<br>\u00bb Increased urination<br>\u00bb Nausea<br>\u00bb Vomiting<br>\u00bb Lethargy<br>\u00bb Rapid breathing<br>\u00bb Fruity breath due to ketosis<br>\u00bb Abdominal pain<br>\u00bb Weakness</p> <h2>Treatment Options</h2> <p><span>It is extremely important to monitor blood sugar levels. If the patient has passed out due to low or high blood sugar, medical help must be sought immediately.</span><br><br><span>\u00bb</span><span> If the cause of diabetic coma (hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia) is unknown, </span><i>do not give insulin</i><span> to the patient.</span><br><span>\u00bb</span><span> If you are confused about the patient's condition, and don't know what to do to keep the patient in a conscious state, </span><i>please do not give the patient anything except water</i><span>.</span><br><br><span>If severe hypoglycemia leads to diabetic coma, the treatment would involve raising blood sugar with the help of glucose. The treatment for advanced diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma would involve insulin therapy, and oral or intravenous administration of fluids and electrolytes to compensate for the loss of body fluids. The dosage of insulin may vary, based on the patient's condition and severity of the symptoms.</span></p> <h2>Tips for Diabetics</h2> <p><span>Consult your physician regularly, and follow the advice of your doctor regarding medicines and lifestyle-related changes.</span><br><br><span>\u00bb</span><span> Keep your blood glucose levels under control.</span><br><span>\u00bb</span><span> If your blood sugar levels are low, have a glucose tablet or a fast-acting carbohydrate.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Steroids and their side effects usually crop up in conversations regarding extraordinary athletic feats and suspiciously prominent muscle tone. Learn more on their hazards right here.</p> <p>Steroids, a class of organic compounds, are man-made synthetic substances and relate to the sex hormone -- testosterone. It is found in both males and females but at a higher degree in males. They contain an arrangement of four cycloalkane rings joined to each other. They are classified as:n<ul>n<li>Corticosteroids (Inhaled, Oral, Injected)</li>n<li>Anabolic Steroids</li>n</ul>nCortisone is a group of hormones that are produced naturally in the human body and helps in regulation of inflammation during injuries. These synthetic compounds are used by doctors to treat allergies, arthritis, asthma, and many more. They are quite different from anabolic steroids, which have been hyped as they are used by sportspersons and bodybuilders. Anabolic steroids increase the muscle mass and help in increasing the stamina of a person.<br><br>The medical uses of steroids include suppression of the human immune system so that certain other medicines can work. In this context, they can be useful medical tools and doctors provide for the side effects by medical means.</p> <h2>Side Effects</h2> <p>The side effects of steroids are legendary. There is categorical evidence which states that the detrimental effects of steroid use have ruined many lives. Anyone who uses steroids for a non-prescribed purpose is asking for trouble. Athletes abuse steroids because these drugs, which inhibit the production of natural hormones, have short-term performance boosting properties. In other words, it is possible to perform certain feats requiring unusual physical strength and endurance for a short period.<br><br>The adverse effects depend on the extent of their use and the user's preexisting condition. With extended use, they are always dangerous and can cause a number of extreme, long-lasting, and sometimes irreversible health problems.</p> <h3>Short-term Effects</h3> <p>Most of the people take steroids for a short period, but there is a chance that they can also face some side effects. These may be temporary and can go away with time.<br><br><strong>Water Retention:</strong> It is an abnormal buildup of fluids in the circulatory system of body that can lead to severe problems.<br><br><strong>Weight Gain:</strong> Intake of steroids increases the appetite of a person that results in weight gain.<br><br><strong>Insomnia:</strong> High dosage of steroids creates changes in sleeping pattern caused by stress and anxiety, which leads to frightening dreams and insomnia.<br><br><strong>Skin Rashes:</strong> Steroids can also be accountable for a lot of skin allergies and rashes for those who have sensitive skin.<br><br><strong>Raised Blood Sugar Levels:</strong> Steroids disrupt the insulin activity of controlling glucose; moreover, it causes liver to produce more glucose, which increases the blood sugar levels.<br><br><strong>Diarrhea:</strong> It is a condition of loose and liquid stools. One has to make frequent trips to the toilet when suffering from diarrhea.<br><br><strong>Bruising:</strong> If steroids are taken through injections, then a person may have bruising in that area.<br><br><strong>High Blood Pressure:</strong> Use of steroids increases the estrogen conversion and increases the level of water and salt in the body, which causes high blood pressure.<br><br><strong>High Cholesterol:</strong> Steroids create an imbalance between the lipoproteins in the body, which increases the risk of developing high cholesterol levels.</p> <h3>Long-term Effects</h3> <p>People take steroids in huge amount and for a longer time so as to get some short-term results; however, they may have to suffer throughout their lives.<br><br><strong>Brain Cancer:</strong> Intake of steroids for a long period can create clots/tumors in the brain, which increases the risk of brain cancer.<br><br><strong>Severe Acne:</strong> The increase in activity of sebaceous glands due to steroid intake emits oil, causing acne on the face, shoulders, and back.<br><br><strong>Weak Tendons:</strong> Steroids act as an outsource for providing testosterone; hence, the natural production of this hormone stops which results in weakening of tendons.<br><br><strong>Jaundice:</strong> Prolonged utilization of steroids may lead to a rare hemorrhagic cystic degeneration of the liver, which leads to jaundice.<br><br><strong>Gynecomastia:</strong> In this situation, men tend to develop breasts due to excess of estrogen -- a female hormone in their body. This feminine appearance is not only embarrassing but painful as well.<br><br><strong>Stunted Growth:</strong> Steroids used at adolescence cause bones to mature too fast and then stops growing, resulting in stunted growth.<br><br><strong>Impotence:</strong> The use of steroids can make a person impotent wherein one can't get proper erections during sexual intercourse.<br><br><strong>Testicular Shrinkage:</strong> It is a severe condition in which the male testes diminishes in size and most of the time loses its functionality.<br><br><strong>Liver Damage:</strong> There is sufficient scientific evidence to indicate that extended steroid use can and does lead to irreversible liver damage.<br><br><strong>Deepening of Voice:</strong> Women who abuse steroids tend to get many characteristics of men as testosterone is being injected in their body; deepening of voice and Adam's apple are a couple of them.<br><br><strong>Heart Attack:</strong> The fallout of steroids can also extend to premature heart attacks and strokes.<br><br><strong>Reduction of Breasts:</strong> Women having steroids may face the problem of breast reduction due to change in the hormonal system of their body.<br><br><strong>Kidney Disease:&nbsp;</strong>The steroidal compounds put a strain on the kidney that causes hurdles in the functioning, which can lead to kidney damage or failure.<br><br><strong>Irregular Menstrual Cycle:</strong> Due to hormonal imbalance, many a time, a woman may observe irregularities in the menstrual cycle.<br><br><strong>Male Pattern Baldness:</strong> Baldness and hair fall have been observed by many steroid abusers, in both men and women, due to overproduction of a hair inhibitor enzyme.<br><br><strong>Facial and Body Hair Growth:</strong> A woman may observe a lot of facial as well as body hair growth just like men.</p> <h3>Others</h3> <p><ul>n<li>A person who is on steroids adopts a violent behavior, or has too many mood swings, which is known as the 'Roid Rage'.</li>n<li>One may also suffer from nausea, vomiting, palpitation, depression, hypertension, and so on.</li>n<li>Hallucination is also one of the side effects reported due to extensive use of steroids. In this, one may see people or hear voices, which are not in real; it is in his mind.</li>n<li>Use of steroids can also create an embarrassing situation as the person tends to have an oily scalp and bad breath all the time.</li>n<li>Steroids also interfere with cholesterol levels, though there is considerable dispute over whether this presents any serious health risk -- they often reduce LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein/bad cholesterol). Moreover, they can elevate HDL cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein), which medical practitioners refer to as the 'good cholesterol' because it assists in protecting the arteries by delivering unused cholesterol to the liver, which breaks it down.</li>n</ul></p> <p>The upshot is that while the adverse effects are often not as extravagant as popular press makes them out to be, they certainly do tamper with the body's natural functioning. With excessive use, steroids can cause permanent and even fatal health damage.</p> <p><em>Disclaimer: The information provided in this article is solely for educating the reader.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Why would you want to go for a Senior Life Settlement? Read this Buzzle article to know its potential benefits.</p> <p>Most of us have a Life Insurance Policy. We pay the monthly premiums and consider it a sound financial investment. And usually it is. In the event of our death, there will be money to pay the taxman, and money to ensure that our family and loved ones will not be left destitute. </p> <p>But sometimes, due to certain changes in your situation, you may no longer need to have an insurance policy, and so there is little point in keeping it and continuing to pay the premiums. So, what you can do is let the premium lapse, which is not a financially smart move, or you can go for a Senior Life Settlement.</p> <p>A Senior Life Settlement involves <b>selling your insurance policy to a firm</b>, instead of returning or surrendering it to your insurance Company. The finance company gives you a greater amount than the cash surrender value of the policy. Unless you know much about finance, you should usually market your policy by hiring the services of a well-qualified and well-experienced broker. This way you will be sure to get yourself the highest deal possible for your policy. </p> <p>It works like this. The finance firm will buy your life insurance policy and thereby own it. It will now be their responsibility to pay the premiums to your insurance company. As this is in their interest, they will pay your premiums and they, not your descendants, will receive the entire amount due in the event of your death.</p> <p>Senior Settlement is not limited to a specific age group. But, normally you will find more takers for your policy if you are 70-years-old or above that age. You also have to be in reasonably good health to go for this type of financial scheme. You will probably be asked to provide details about your medical history before the contract is finalized.</p> <p>There are numerous reasons why you might want to sell your Life Insurance Policy: <br /><br />1. As mentioned before, you may <b>no longer require the policy</b>. You don't have any family, friends, or favorite charities to leave money or property to after you're gone, and so having it is pointless. You don't need it. And you can use the money you get from selling it to try out all the different things that you always dreamed of doing. Live it up while you still can, you know. That sort of thing.</p> <p>2. It is no longer possible for you to keep up with or pay the regular Insurance Premiums. <b>Failing to pay</b> could cause the policy to lapse and mean financial loss for you. Selling the Policy before it lapses will be more profitable.</p> <p>3. You need the money to <b>repay an outstanding debt</b>.<br /><br /><span>4. You want extra retirement funds to\u00a0</span><b>meet your daily living costs</b><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>5. You want to\u00a0</span><b>monetarily assist</b><span>\u00a0your family. Maybe your kid is going to college or starting a business, and funds are really needed.</span><br /><br /><span>6. You need to make a\u00a0</span><b>divorce settlement</b><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>7. You want to\u00a0</span><b>donate to a charity</b><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>8. You want to try your luck in the\u00a0</span><b>stock market</b><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>9. You want to buy a new and\u00a0</span><b>better insurance policy</b><span>.</span></p> <p>If you change your mind after selling your policy, and don't want the firm to inherit your dough, you can cancel the contract within 15 days of having received the money. Just make sure this stipulation is present on the contract before you sign it. If you should die within 15 days of receiving the money, and there is no statement regarding this eventuality in the contract, the policy gets canceled.</p>"

It stimulates the growth of internal organs including bones, and plays a major role in homeostatic mechanisms, immune system processes, cell division, fat and glucose metabolism, and several other cellular processes. It is secreted by the body during growth years, and peaks during puberty. The levels of this hormone begin to decline after physical and reproductive maturation.</p> <p>From its use as a treatment option for HGH deficiency, back in the first half of 20th century, this hormone has come a long way to become one of the most popular performance-enhancing drugs. This is because of the ability to synthesize recombinant growth hormone (rHGH) in the lab as against the earlier method of extraction from human cadavers.</p> <p>The therapeutic use of HGH is considered to be safe, and is legally approved. However, the off-label use and overdose of HGH for weight loss, muscle building, anti-aging benefits, etc. has been associated with certain adverse effects.</p> <p><div><strong>Side Effects</strong></div>nAn age-related decline in the levels of this hormone leads to a decrease in muscle mass, increase in the fat content, as well as decreased libido. This understanding led to the investigation and research regarding the anti-aging effects of this hormone. In fact, a few studies reported increased lipolysis and reversal of muscle wasting when therapeutic doses of HGH were administered in healthy adults. Even though the medical fraternity is divided about the anti-aging benefits of HGH, this research brought about a surge in the use of HGH injections, supplements and HGH stimulating substances for reversal of aging as well as for weight loss and muscle building.</p> <p>The therapeutic doses of HGH are usually considered safe, and no significant side effects have been observed in such cases. Injection-site reaction is one of the reported side effect in many cases. However, the prolonged use of HGH has been associated with the following side effects:</p> <p><div>n<div><strong>Acromegaly</strong></div>nIt is the most commonly observed long-term side effect, and is characterized by overgrowth of facial bones leading to protruding jaw and eyebrow bones. It also involves an abnormal growth of the hands and feet with as well as increased body hair. Contrary to the claims which say that HGH helps you live longer, acromegaly in fact, shortens your lifespan, and may lead to premature aging and death. The signs and symptoms includen<div>n<ul>n<li>&nbsp;Fatigue</li>n<li>&nbsp;Headache</li>n<li>&nbsp;Muscle weakness</li>n<li>&nbsp;Sleep apnea</li>n<li>&nbsp;Joint pain</li>n<li>&nbsp;Swelling around joints</li>n<li>&nbsp;Hoarseness</li>n<li>&nbsp;Excessive sweating</li>n<li>&nbsp;Widened fingers and toes</li>n</ul>n</div>n</div>n<br>n<div>n<div><strong>Carpal tunnel syndrome</strong></div>nStudies regarding the changes in physical composition owing to the administration of HGH, revealed the development of carpal tunnel syndrome as one of the many HGH side effects. It is characterized by pinching of the median nerve, which runs from the forearm to the palm. This leads to:n<div>n<ul>n<li><span>&nbsp;Weakened grip</span></li>n<li>&nbsp;Weakness in hand(s)</li>n<li>&nbsp;Clumsy finger movements</li>n<li>&nbsp;Elbow pain</li>n<li>&nbsp;Finger and wrist pain</li>n<li>&nbsp;Numbness/tingling in hands</li>n</ul>n</div>n</div>n<br>n<div>n<div><strong>Other side effects</strong></div>n<div>n<ul>n<li>&nbsp;Extended belly</li>n<li>&nbsp;Muscle and joint pain</li>n<li>&nbsp;Increased body hair</li>n<li>&nbsp;Increased hunger</li>n<li>&nbsp;High cholesterol levels</li>n<li>&nbsp;Abnormal fat distribution</li>n<li>&nbsp;Tissue edema</li>n<li>&nbsp;Dry and itchy skin</li>n<li>&nbsp;Altered glucose metabolism</li>n</ul>n</div>n</div>n<br>n<div>n<div><strong>Risks</strong></div>nProlonged use of HGH has been associated with an increased risk for:n<div>n<ul>n<li>&nbsp;Diabetes</li>n<li>&nbsp;Liver damage</li>n<li>&nbsp;Hypothyroidism</li>n<li>&nbsp;Heart enlargement</li>n<li>&nbsp;Hardening of arteries</li>n<li>&nbsp;Gynecomastia (enlarged breast tissue in men)</li>n</ul>n</div>n</div>n<br>The side effects of indiscriminate use of HGH get worse when counterfeit products are used. Individuals who share needles to inject themselves with HGH are at a high risk of transmission of blood-borne viruses - the deadliest and most common being the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p> <p><div><strong>Claims and Controversies</strong></div>nHGH has been touted to resolve a number of health issues, and several claims have been made by manufacturers of HGH products like HGH injections, supplements, homeopathic HGH sprays and drops, etc. The use of HGH supplements has increased manifolds over the last few decades, and the credit for this goes to the hordes of advertisements wherein HGH is <span>claimed to be a magic potion</span> with the ability to cure a variety of ailments. According to the proponents of HGH, these products will:n<div>n<ul>n<li>&nbsp;Increase stamina</li>n<li>&nbsp;Reduce body fat</li>n<li>&nbsp;Increase muscle mass</li>n<li>&nbsp;Increase immunity</li>n<li>&nbsp;Reduce wrinkles</li>n<li>&nbsp;Improve skin texture</li>n<li>&nbsp;Improve vision</li>n<li>&nbsp;Improve memory</li>n<li>&nbsp;Enable fast wound healing</li>n<li>&nbsp;Boost sexual life</li>n<li>&nbsp;Improve bone health</li>n<li>&nbsp;Regrow hair on bald head</li>n</ul>n</div>n<br>Many people resort to HGH for its alleged muscle-building, stamina-increasing and anti-aging properties. However, numerous questions about the credibility of HGH supplements are yet to be answered. Medical experts discourage the use of HGH products owing to the <span>lack of significant scientific evidence</span> for the above-mentioned claims. This is especially valid in case of homeopathic HGH products which were found to contain water and other ingredients, but no HGH. In addition, scientific studies supporting the therapeutic use of HGH, involve the use of pure HGH injections. Hence, these reports and studies cannot be considered as an evidence in favor of homeopathic drops and sprays.</p> <p>It has been argued that all these claims are an attempt to market and sell fraudulent products in order to make money. In 2005, the Federal Trade Commission had charged a group of companies for the manufacture and sale of fraudulent HGH and oregano oil products, through deceptive advertisements and false claims. More than $20 million had to be paid as consumer redress to settle the charges.</p> <p><div><strong>Approved Usage of HGH</strong></div>nOptimum levels of human growth hormone is crucial for the regulation of several metabolic processes of the body as well as the normal growth and development of an individual. The production and secretion of this hormone is influenced by a variety of factors including stress, exercise, as well as certain genetic and non-genetic disorders.</p> <p>Therapeutic use of HGH been legally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children and adults, idiopathic short stature, Turner syndrome, and in small for gestational age (SGA) infants. In addition, the use of HGH therapy is being studied in other genetic disorders that affect growth.</p> <p>HGH therapy may prove to be a boon for individuals suffering from several disorders, but such exogenous administration of HGH may not be safe for prolonged nontherapeutic use. The HGH side effects experienced may be mild in certain individuals, but may affect the longevity in some. Any drastic action against the normal body processes, is often associated with some adverse effect. It is always safer to opt for regular exercise and a wholesome diet to achieve good health.</p> <p><i>Disclaimer: This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Settled in life and wish to keep this lifestyle all throughout? Starting out in life and wishing some coverage of the various risks you are sure to take? Whole life insurance policy is one of the options available.</p> <p>We live in a fast-moving world. We are so busy with our day-to-day happenings that we seldom find time to give to ourselves. Most of our time in life is spent in creating a safe and secure future for ourselves and our family. It is ironic that we seldom find time to secure our family's future, in case we are caught in some fatal calamity.</p> <p>Life insurance takes care of our family's future in the wake of any untoward incidence. There are many types of such policies today. One of the most commonly bought policies is the whole life insurance policy.</p> <h2>Description</h2> <p>It is a policy that generally pays a lump sum in the event of the death of the insured to his/her dependents. In some cases, the earlier diagnosis of a critical illness also results in the said payment. The only requirement is that the policy is kept in force with the required payments being made in time. This policy is sometimes called straight life insurance policy or permanent life policies.</p> <p>These like every other policy depend wholly on the premiums. There are different ways in which the insured can pay the same. Some policies have a single premium or a fixed periodic premium, or sometimes, it can be paying a lump sum amount in a flexible period.</p> <p>Apart from covering the risk of life, these policies are also sane and safe investments. If the insured decides to cancel the policy midway, he will be paid in full, whatever premiums he has paid till that day. Thus, this insurance type is indeed a way of making some tax free savings.</p> <h2>Reasons to Consider This Option</h2> <p>Whole life policies are different from those of term insurance. The latter is for a set time, and the insured is paid a lump sum amount after the end of the term of the policy or if he expires during this term. Depending on the type of policy, he may get certain bonuses.</p> <p>However, under the former policy, either the dependents get a lump sum amount in the case of death of the person who is insured, or at the diagnosis of a critical disease. This system is actually more preferable, because a set amount of money is guaranteed even after the death of that person.</p> <p>The insured cannot claim in the case of death after the term of the life insurance policy, nor can the policy be encashed. Simply put, such a policy covers the risk of death only till a set period of time. The whole policy, on the other hand, covers the same at any given time.</p> <p>One should do careful research regarding the various policies and their features, benefits, and returns. One should also think about his or her financial capabilities before opting for any higher-end policy. One buys it for coverage of risk at an economical and affordable rate. If you have to work harder or more to cover such a policy, you have lost it.</p> <p>One can find out about the various policies, either online or by calling up the company itself. Although the insurance is a non-tangible commodity, it is extremely necessary, and it is never too early or too late to opt for an affordable policy.</p>"

A child, with this condition, has a lower IQ (of 50) and low understanding, reasoning and perception abilities.</p> <p>In the United States, 1 out of every 691 children is born with this condition. Though, a cure is yet to be found, researches have shown that with special care and recognition in society, the life expectancy of such individuals has increased.</p> <h3>What Causes Down Syndrome?</h3> <p>A human child inherits 23 pairs of chromosome from his parents. 23 chromosomes from the egg cell of the mother and 23 chromosomes from the sperm cell of the father, which make a total of 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome carries genes from each parent. However, sometimes an extra chromosome is inherited by the embryo, from either of the parents. Down syndrome or DS is caused when a child inherits this extra <em>chromosome 21</em>, completely or partially. Out of all the cases that have been studied, 5% fathers have been found as the donor of the added chromosome 21. This additional genetic material alters the overall development of a child.</p> <h3>What are the Chances of a Child Being Born with DS?</h3> <p>Down's syndrome can occur in any person, regardless of the race or any other factor. Although, children born to women of older age are often diagnosed with it. It is the only <em>known</em> risk factor that increases the chances of Down syndrome.</p> <p><div class=\"ct-table-wrap\">n<table class=\"ct-table-bordered ct-table\">n<tbody>n<tr>n<td><strong>Maternal Age</strong></td>n<td><strong>Risk of Down Syndrome</strong></td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td>20</td>n<td>1 in 2,000</td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td>25</td>n<td>1 in 1,200</td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td>30</td>n<td>1 in 900</td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td>35</td>n<td>1 in 350</td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td>40</td>n<td>1 in 100</td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td>45</td>n<td>1 in 30</td>n</tr>n<tr>n<td>50</td>n<td>1 in 10</td>n</tr>n</tbody>n</table>n</div>n<br>Couples, who have conceived a child with Down's syndrome, have an increased risk of conceiving another child with a similar condition.</p> <h3>What are the Types of DS?</h3> <p>There are three kinds of patterns of chromosome, that have known to be the cause of Down syndrome.</p> <p><em>Trisomy 21:</em> In Down's syndrome, a child has three copies of the chromosome 21. So, it is also called <em>trisomy 21</em><i>.</i> Usually, during conception, the embryo has two sets of chromosome 21. But sometimes, an extra chromosome fails to separate itself from either the egg cell or the sperm cell. This chromosome then gets duplicated in every cell of the body. Trisomy 21 is found to be the prominent kind of this syndrome. Almost 95% cases of Down's syndrome are trisomy 21.</p> <p><em>Translocation</em>: During cell division in an embryo, sometimes, a part of chromosome 21 detaches and adheres to <em>chromosome 14</em>. This is known as translocation. Although, the number of chromosomes present in each cell is 46, the extra genes from partial chromosome 21 causes the disorders in growth of the embryo, and leads to Down syndrome. 4 - 5% cases of DS are caused due to translocation.</p> <p><em>Mosaicism</em>: In genetics, the presence of different genes in one or more cells in an individual, is referred to as mosaicism. In Down's syndrome, it refers to presence of genes of the third chromosome 21 in the cell. There has not been much research on Mosaic DS, but studies have shown that kids with MDS have higher IQ than the kids with the Down syndrome. As, only a small percentage of cells are affected by mosaicism, there are very less characteristics of DS present in the child. However, speech delay is reported as one of the symptoms of this disorder.</p> <h3>What are the Signs and Symptoms?</h3> <p>The major characteristic of DS is <em>neoteny</em> or hindered maturity. Based on the type, an individual with DS may have all or some of these physical traits:n<ul>n<li>Unusually small chin</li>n<li>Poor muscle tone</li>n<li>Brushfield spots (white spots on iris)</li>n<li>Single crease on the palm</li>n<li>Flat nasal bridge</li>n<li>Broad hands with short fingers</li>n<li>Small ears</li>n<li>Loose joint ligaments</li>n<li>Creases on eyelids</li>n<li>Protruding tongue</li>n<li>Flattened face</li>n<li>Space between big and second toe</li>n</ul>nOn reaching adolescence, they tend to have a short stature. The average height of a male with DS is 5 ft 1 inch and that of a female is 4 ft 9 inches.</p> <h3>How is DS Diagnosed?</h3> <p>Down's syndrome is usually diagnosed at <em>birth</em>. The physical characteristics of the infant, such as upward slant of the eyes and flat facial structure, are the signs that may lead to diagnosis of the disorder. However, there are several chromosomal analysis processes that the doctor may resort to, for positive confirmation. These analysis are called <em>karyotype</em>, where a blood sample from the baby is tested to check for chromosomal anomalies. Another test, <em>FISH </em>(Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization), takes lesser time and helps in faster diagnosis.</p> <p>There are many <em>prenatal screening tests</em> available, that are absolutely noninvasive. A diagnosis before the baby is born, gives the parents time to prepare and get genetic counseling. However, prenatal screening tests only estimate the chances of the baby being born with DS. AFP or alpha-fetoprotein screening test is the most widely used and reliable test. Blood sample of the expecting mother is taken between 15 - 20 weeks of pregnancy, and checked for higher levels (indicate chances of DS) of AFP and three other hormones. An ultrasound between 11 - 13 weeks of pregnancy, known as <em>nuchal translucency test</em>, is done to check the thickness of fold of the neck. When taken with maternal age, this test has proved to be correct for 80% of the cases.</p> <p>Apart from the above-mentioned screening tests, there are several other diagnostic tests as well. However, these tests are invasive, and carry a slight risk of miscarriage.</p> <p>One such test is <i>Amniocentesis</i>, done during 16 - 20 weeks of pregnancy. A small sample of amniotic fluid is extracted via a needle, inserted into the abdominal wall. This fluid is then tested from chromosomal anomalies.</p> <p><em>Chorionic Villus Sampling </em>(CVS) is done by extracting chorionic villus cell sample from the placenta, taken either through a needle inserted into the abdominal wall, or catheter in vagina. It is done between 11 - 12 weeks of pregnancy, and the sample is tested for any alterations.</p> <h3>What are the Other Conditions Associated with DS?</h3> <p>The major consequence of DS is <em>cognitive impairment</em>.The ways through which the extra chromosome 21 affects the development of a child's learning and understanding abilities, are still unknown. Also, a number of people with DS have been identified with various heart defects, cancer and other medical conditions that include:n<ul>n<li>Hearing loss</li>n<li>Obesity</li>n<li>Dementia</li>n<li>Alzheimer's</li>n<li>Obsessive Compulsion Disorder (OCD)</li>n<li>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</li>n</ul></p> <h3>How to Manage DS?</h3> <p>The cause behind Down syndrome is known - <em>the third copy of chromosome 21</em>. Every chromosome has more than 250 genes. Genealogists have identified almost every gene present on this particular chromosome. However, a cure is yet to be found. Researches and clinical trials are ongoing all over the world, but they are in a very primary stage.</p> <p>Although, there is no cure for DS yet, however, the conditions associated with it can be treated via organ replacement and other medical procedures. A person with DS must get regular medical check-ups done, as early detection of any other disorder or ailment will assist in the treatment.</p> <p>Apart from all medical facilities, it is very important that these individuals are considered a part of the society. They must be assured that they belong here, with everyone. Like every other child, they need to be nurtured and encouraged. There are many programs for people with special needs, which concentrate on development of such people. They focus on speech, occupational and physical therapies. These programs have definitely increased and improved the quality of life for people with DS.</p> <p>Also, as they reach adolescence, it is vital to make them aware of the physical changes that they go through during puberty. Although, girls with DS are not very fertile, they do have regular menstrual periods and can get pregnant. Similarly, there are cases where men with DS have fathered a child.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Is it normal to have mucus in your stool? Well, the passage of a small amount of mucus in the fecal matter should not worry you, but do consult a doctor if you have been passing visible amounts of mucus in stool on a regular basis. It could be a sign of a digestive disorder. The following write-up provides information on some of these disorders.</p> <p>Mucus is a slimy secretion that is produced by the mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, sinuses, throat, lungs, and the digestive tract. The production of mucus is one of the protective mechanisms employed by our body. One of the basic functions of mucus is to lubricate or moisten the underlying tissues. The secretion of mucus also facilitates the passage of food from the esophagus to the stomach. The bicarbonate ions and mucus which are secreted by the epithelial cells of the stomach also protect the lining of the stomach from the acidic environment created by gastric juices. It acts as a lubricant, thereby facilitating the passage of food in the digestive tract, until it is excreted out. The presence of a small amount of clear mucus in stool is normal, but the amount of mucus could increase if a person is suffering from a digestive ailment. Consult a doctor under these circumstances, and inform him/her about the other symptoms that may be accompanied by increased amounts of mucus in feces.</p> <h3>Conditions that Could Cause Mucus in Feces</h3> <p>There are various medical conditions that can cause one to pass mucus in stool. Thus, it is always better to get the underlying cause diagnosed and treated at the earliest.</p> <p><strong>Ulcerative Colitis</strong> <br>Ulcerative colitis is a form of inflammatory bowel disease that is characterized by inflammation of the innermost lining of the large intestine and the rectum. When the inflammation is restricted to the rectum, the condition is referred to as ulcerative proctitis. The inflammation could give rise to the formation of open sores or lesions. At a later stage, these ulcers could bleed and the affected individual may suffer from frequent episodes of diarrhea. He/she may notice traces of blood or mucus in the stool. Other symptoms of this inflammatory bowel disease include:</p> <p><span>\u25ba</span> Abdominal pain and cramps<br><span>\u25ba</span> Constipation<br><span>\u25ba</span> Diarrhea<br><span>\u25ba</span> Rectal pain<br><span>\u25ba</span> Weight loss</p> <p><strong>Crohn's Disease</strong> <br>Crohn's disease is another type of inflammatory bowel disease that could affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Genetic or immunological factors could be responsible for causing this condition. The chronic inflammation of the affected part of the gastrointestinal tract could be due to an abnormal immune response to a bacterium or a virus. While the presence of blood in stool could be a sign of this condition, at times stool may also contain mucus. This could occur when the affected individuals develop anal fissures (tear in the lining of the anus). Other symptoms that may be experienced by people affected by this condition include:</p> <p><span>\u25ba</span> Abdominal cramps<br><span>\u25ba</span> Loss of appetite<br><span>\u25ba</span> Watery stools<br><span>\u25ba</span> Weight loss<br><span>\u25ba</span> Fatigue<br><span>\u25ba</span> Pain during bowel movement</p> <p><strong>Infections</strong> <br>The human gastrointestinal tract contains beneficial bacteria that help in maintaining the balance of microbial flora. When this balance is affected by overgrowth of pathogens, the process of digestion is adversely affected. The natural microbial balance gets disturbed when the disease-causing bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, <i>Salmonella enteritidis</i>, <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>, <i>Shigella sonnei</i>), viruses (<i>Adenoviruses</i>, <i>Astroviruses</i>, <i>Caliciviruses</i>, <i>Noroviruses</i>, <i>Rotaviruses</i>), and parasites (<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>, <i>Giardia lamblia</i>) enter the body. This can cause gastroenteritis, which is a condition that is characterized by inflammation of the stomach and the intestines. Infections that are caused by these pathogens can give rise to symptoms such as:</p> <p><span>\u25ba</span> Diarrhea with mucus<br><span>\u25ba</span> Abdominal cramps<br><span>\u25ba</span> Fever<br><span>\u25ba</span> Nausea<br><span>\u25ba</span> Bloating</p> <p><strong>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</strong> <br>The exact cause of IBS is not known, but it is believed that it could be triggered by an acute gastrointestinal infection. It is believed that the symptoms of this condition worsen due to stress. IBS is classified as diarrhea-predominant, constipation-predominant, or IBS with an alternating stool pattern. People who suffer from IBS may also observe increased levels of mucus in stools. It has been observed that mucus formation is higher in those with diarrhea-predominant IBS. The common symptoms of IBS include:</p> <p><span>\u25ba</span> Pain in the abdominal region<br><span>\u25ba</span> Cramping<br><span>\u25ba</span> Bloating<br><span>\u25ba</span> Change in bowel habits</p> <p><strong>Bowel Obstruction</strong> <br>This medical condition is caused by physical or functional obstruction of the bowel. The mechanical causes of bowel obstruction include tumors, adhesions, gallstones, impacted stool, intussusception (when a part of the intestine slides into the adjacent section) or abnormal twisting of the intestine. Such an obstruction stalls the transit of digested food or waste. Whatever be the cause, the condition is considered to be a medical emergency. The symptoms of this medical condition include:</p> <p><span>\u25ba</span> Abdominal cramps<br><span>\u25ba</span> Abdominal pain<br><span>\u25ba</span> Abdominal distention<br><span>\u25ba</span> Inability to pass gas<br><span>\u25ba</span> Constipation<br><span>\u25ba</span> Vomiting</p> <p><strong>Diverticulosis</strong> <br>The term 'diverticulum' refers to an abnormal sac-like structure that forms in the large intestine. It is believed that such pouches develop when the waste that is stored by the large intestine becomes hard and puts pressure on the walls of the colon. The formation of these pouches is referred to as diverticulosis. More often than not, this condition is asymptomatic. However, formation of many such pouches could give rise to symptoms such as:</p> <p><span>\u25ba</span> Abdominal pain<br><span>\u25ba</span> Constipation<br><span>\u25ba</span> Diarrhea<br><span>\u25ba</span> Flatulence<br><span>\u25ba</span> Bloating<br><span>\u25ba</span> Mucus or blood in the feces</p> <p>Inflammation of these pouches is medically referred to as diverticulitis. These pouches may become inflamed when bacteria act on the fecal matter that is trapped inside diverticula. The symptoms of diverticulitis include:</p> <p><span>\u25ba</span> Sharp abdominal pain<br><span>\u25ba</span> Distended abdomen<br><span>\u25ba</span> Nausea and vomiting<br><span>\u25ba</span> Fever</p> <p>Although the passage of mucus in stool is not always a cause of serious concern, consult a doctor if it has been occurring on a daily basis. Besides the aforementioned medical conditions, excess mucus in stool could be due to an anal fistula (a small connection or channel that develops between the anal canal and the skin near the anus) or rectal ulcers. The development of a malignant growth in the colon could also be a contributory factor. Though the use of drugs would provide relief, ensure that you make dietary modifications and other lifestyle changes that have been suggested by your doctor.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>The information provided in this article is solely for educating the reader.

    "post_name": "short-term-disability-insurance",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Short-term disability insurance can be served as a temporary solution to your financial crisis in the initial period of your sickness. Let us have a look at few details and the things one should look for before purchasing the appropriate policy.</p> <p>There will be a situation in life when you are injured or become sick. You can't work and then the question will arise - How can you maintain your existing living standards without having any income at your disposal? You will find it difficult to pay your monthly bills. It will be a very worse situation if you are dependent on your daily income to meet your daily needs, expenditure. It is the situation you can land into, once or more in your life. The answer for this big question mark lies in short-term disability insurance.</p> <p>As the name implies, in general, it is an insurance package that covers your disability period and can be a substitute for your income when you are unable to work due to illness or injury. Principally, it comes in two major types of coverage, namely short-term and long-term.</p> <h3>Explanation</h3> <p>This type of plan provides an income for short term, ranging from two weeks to two years. It covers the early part of your disability. Often, it is included as part of an employee benefit plan. Again, the insurance makes a form of income security during the waiting period before long-term disability benefits start. Moreover, this coverage is voluntary, implying that the premium can be paid wholly by the employee.</p> <p>Before choosing the right policy, it's very essential for you to check the definition of disability in the policy.</p> <h3>Definition</h3> <p>The definition varies from policy to policy. A close look at it can help you to find the most appropriate insurance plan. Some plans identify your disability when you're unable to continue your existing occupation. Thus, they will pay you if you are disabled to engage in the same occupation.</p> <p>Other plans have a different definition, stating it as a stage when you are unable to continue any occupation that is best suited for you. These fields of occupations can be determined by your educational, professional qualifications, and your experience in various fields.</p> <p>Generally, it is a common practice to use the definition of own existing occupation for the insurance. Some policies also require that you should not be gainfully employed while getting their benefits. Moreover, some plans can use the theory of residual benefit, which means that you will get a portion of your monthly benefit if the disability has resulted in reducing certain part of your monthly income.</p> <h3>Waiting Period</h3> <p>Most of such plans exercise the concept of waiting period. The most common one is of 90 days. The length of this period is to be decided by an individual by assessing his own capability to pull on without payment in the period of disability. The longer the waiting period you decide, lower will be the premium.</p> <h3>Riders</h3> <p>Most of the companies that offer insurance plans also offer optional benefits to enhance the given policies.</p> <p><strong>Guaranteed Insurability Option</strong><br />Also known as future purchase options, this rider comes with an additional facility to purchase extra disability income insurance with the increase in your monthly income. Even if at later stage, a situation arose to prevent you from getting additional coverage, still you can get your benefit increased.</p> <p><strong>Residual Benefit</strong><br />This rider pays you a portion of your monthly income if you are witnessing reduced monthly income because of disability. In this case, you are required to comply with the minimum percentage of loss as a qualification. In most of the cases, it is 20% of your total income.</p> <p><strong>Cost of Living Adjustment</strong><br />This rider provides an annual increment on a predetermined percentage, which can help you to overcome the inflation rate.</p> <p>Riders often make lucrative offers. But, beware before opting for any of them; you have to compare the cost with the benefits you are getting and judge the probability of using the benefits of the rider in the future. There are numerous ways to get the coverage. Some companies offer a group plan for the employees. The purchase of an individual policy is always there. The premium varies according to your health, age, policy features, and risky nature of the job.</p> <p>Before purchasing the policy, compare different offers from different insurers. Check whether the policy is guaranteed renewable or non-cancelable. Try to go for non-cancelable one. Try to buy the policy at younger age, so that your premium will be in low amounts and will be easy for you to pay them regularly in time. Look for that insurance company, which is financially stronger and have good claims paying history.</p> <p>Before filing a claim, you will be required written documents showing your disability. They usually require letter from your physician, narrating the related details.</p> <p>This insurance enables you to alleviate your financial worries during such tough times. So, you can concentrate your energy to improve your health and future.</p>"

    "post_name": "male-yeast-infection",
    "post_content": "<p>Although male yeast infection is not generally talked about, it certainly exists. Given in this article, are some of the various causes, and a little more information in general, on male yeast infection...</p> <p>Many people, obviously males, believe that yeast infection occurs only in women. This is completely untrue, as a yeast infection can occur, and does occur, in males as well. Male yeast infection, unfortunately, tends to go undiagnosed due to the fact that most males do not think that they are prone to a yeast infection. This gives rise to statistics that show a much higher number of females suffering from this condition, hence, supporting the erroneous idea that males cannot be affected by a yeast infection.</p> <p>Yeast infection in males can occur in different places, with the mouth, skin, and genitals being the most prominent places where the infection occurs. However, the most common of these is penile yeast infection, or yeast infection affecting the genitals.</p> <h2>Symptoms</h2> <p>If you are suffering from a yeast infection, there are certain symptoms that will begin to develop, and these can be a good indication that you need to visit a doctor, to be treated. Note that not all symptoms may be seen, and by no means are these symptoms the only yardstick to diagnose if you are suffering from a yeast infection.</p> <p>Here are a few of the common symptoms.n<ul>n<li>Bad Breath</li>n<li>Constipation</li>n<li>Indigestion</li>n<li>Frequent Intestinal Gas</li>n<li>Abnormal Loose Stools</li>n<li>Sexual Dysfunction</li>n<li>Mood Swings</li>n<li>Frequent Fatigue</li>n<li>Loss of Energy</li>n<li>Irritability</li>n<li>Prostate Problems</li>n<li>Athlete's Feet</li>n<li>Bloating</li>n<li>Indigestion</li>n<li>Memory Loss (in extreme cases)</li>n</ul></p> <p>In addition to these, there are some more indications of a penile yeast infection, and they include:n<ul>n<li>Burning sensation during intercourse and urinating</li>n<li>The tip of the penis appears red</li>n<li>The penis develops small reddish-whitish blisters</li>n<li>The skin becomes itchy and flaky</li>n<li>The entire genital area shows signs of blisters, bumps, or rash</li>n<li>The penis becomes sore, especially to touch</li>n<li>A whitish discharge is seen, especially under the foreskin</li>n<li>The head of the penis may become swollen</li>n<li>The penile skin may become dry and prone to cracking when an erection is attained</li>n</ul></p> <h2>Causes</h2> <p>There are various causes of yeast infection, and these range from drinking too much beer, to wearing or remaining in wet underclothes. The main causes of a yeast infection in men are as follows:n<ul>n<li>Sexual Intercourse</li>n<li>Poor Genital Hygiene</li>n<li>Bacterial Infection</li>n<li>Allergies (to latex and condoms)</li>n<li>Antibiotics</li>n<li>Diabetes</li>n<li>Nonoxynol-9</li>n</ul></p> <p>Apart from these, there are a few more cases where one can get a yeast infection. Uncircumcised men are at a greater risk of getting a yeast infection, since the foreskin holds more moisture. HIV positive men also face a great risk of getting a yeast infection. In the case of gay men, the use of condoms are known to attribute to yeast infections. The lubricant containing nonoxynol-9 acts as a contributing factor to anal yeast infection in men. Nonoxynol-9 is known to contribute to the development of vaginal yeast infections in women.</p> <p>Yeast infection can also occur in young boys too. In the incident that feces touches the penis, the bacteria in the feces can cause a yeast infection. Diaper rash can also cause penile yeast infection. Damp clothing is another reason of such penile yeast infections, because the dampness provides an excellent atmosphere for the bacteria to grow and multiply. Children also face a chronic oral cavity yeast infection, in which there are white patches around the mouth.</p> <p>This generally happens between the age of six and nine. Male yeast infection can occur in men of all ages. Men who are sexually active or engage in certain sexual activities are more prone to yeast infections. Such yeast infections can also be transmitted sexually during unprotected sexual intercourse. If your female sexual partner is infected with a yeast infection, then it is always suggested to get yourself checked for yeast infection.</p> <p>Most times, if treated on time, this infection is a minor problem. It can be treated with ointments and antifungal creams. There are many prescription drugs available in the market which are known to treat penile yeast infections.</p> <p>Men generally contract yeast infections due to females. If the female has herself treated for a yeast infection, while the male hasn't, chances are that the female may contract the yeast infection during the next sexual intercourse. Therefore, till the time both partners have not checked and cured their yeast infection, it will continue to be a vicious circle. If men are facing yeast infections, they should have their fasting glucose level checked.</p>"

    "post_title": "Are ear tubes right for my child?",

    "post_name": "are-ear-tubes-right-for-my-child",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Although ear tube insertion is one of the most common childhood surgeries, it may not always be the right choice for your child. Given below is some more information about the same.</p> <p>Statistics show that middle ear infections are the second most common childhood infections, and that two out of every three children have at least one before the age of six. Middle ear infections can be viral or bacterial in nature. The bacterial ones can be treated with antibiotics. However, for the viral kind, the only real options are to treat the pain symptoms and wait for the infection to clear up on its own. This can take anywhere from four to nine days, sometimes longer for very young children.</p> <p>However, if your child has recurrent ear infections, or is having a problem with fluid behind the eardrum that persists for weeks or more, it is best to consult a doctor. It is common for there to be some fluid in the ear for two to three weeks after an infection, but not longer than that. Antibiotics can be prescribed, but may not always be the best solution. Another option is to have ear tubes inserted in your child's ears. However, it is important for parents to make sure that they understand the procedure, what results it can and cannot produce, and the possible risks, before going through with it.</p> <p>With over a half a million children having ear tubes inserted each year, it is one of the most common childhood surgeries among those requiring anesthesia. There are a number of benefits to this simple surgical procedure, including a reduced risk of future ear infections, improved balance and speech, better night-time sleep, and even a possible improvement in the behavioral problems being exhibited by your child. The procedure itself is short, generally thirty minutes or less; children often experience immediate improved hearing after the fluid is drained, and the recovery period is short as well, usually two to three days.</p> <p>However, despite the simplicity of the procedure and its possible benefits, some parents are still hesitant about undertaking it. It is after all, a surgery under general anesthesia, which is not something to enter into lightly. Furthermore, while tubes can provide some real relief for many children having chronic ear infections or fluid in the ear, sometimes, the surgery is recommended unnecessarily for children in cases where the problem could resolve itself or easily be treated with antibiotics. One study estimates that as many as twenty-five percent of ear tube surgeries were not necessary for the children receiving them, and puts the number at thirty-three percent for children who would be considered only borderline in need of receiving them.</p> <p>Whenever parents are making the decision to embark upon a course of medical treatment for their children, a thorough understanding of the risks involved is extremely important. The insertion of ear tubes does carry some risks such as complications from anesthesia, perforation of or scarring in the eardrums, and chronic drainage from the ear. Additionally, in rare cases, if the first set of tubes does not solve the problem, or one or both the tubes fall out prematurely, repeat surgeries may be required. It should be noted that possible scarring of the eardrum does not always result in a loss of hearing, although that is one of the rare possible risks to consider; in addition, perforated eardrums may require future surgeries to repair them.</p> <p>If your pediatrician or ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist) has recommended tubes for your child, you should familiarize yourself with a study done by physician and researcher Jack L. Paradise. His research focused primarily on ear tubes inserted in cases where a child had persistent middle-ear fluid, and not where a child had repeated painful ear infections. His findings brought about a change in the guidelines for recommendations of ear tube surgeries for children with persistent fluid in the ear. They encouraged doctors to take a \"Watch and Wait\" approach combined with frequent hearing assessments to see if the problems resolved themselves over time. The study showed that in a significant number of cases, they did. However, it was also noted that, in cases where the child had a tested hearing loss of forty decibels or higher, or already had a documented language delay, tubes still were the recommended course of treatment.</p> <p>In the end, it is up to the parents to make sure that they understand their pediatrician's or ENT's rationale for recommending the surgery, and to verify with a second opinion if necessary, that their child truly needs it. They should also consider and understand the possible risks associated with the surgery, before making the decision to proceed with it.</p>"

It is present in the cells and body fluids as potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>) and potassium chloride (KCl). 98% of the total potassium content in our body is found intracellular.</p> <h3>Importance of Potassium</h3> <p>Potassium is a mineral salt (electrolyte), that plays an important role in regulating our blood pressure, bone mass, muscle functions as well as heart, kidney, and adrenal functions. Potassium is required in the body for:<ul><li>Maintaining the osmotic and acid-base balance of cells</li><li>Activation of certain enzymes</li><li>Building proteins and muscles</li><li>Metabolizing carbohydrates</li><li>Regulating the electrical activity of heart</li><li>Regulating neuron-muscular signals to voluntary and involuntary muscles</li><li>Maintaining bone mineral density</li></ul>Potassium deficiency disrupts the balance between intracellular and extracellular potassium content, and may lead to reduction in the levels of potassium in blood (hypokalemia). This condition is characterized by fatigue, myalgia, joint pain, muscle stiffness and cramps, depression, mood alterations, and slow reflexes. Severe deficiency may lead to cardiac problems, altered renal function, gastric problems as well as liver damage.</p> <h2>Potassium-rich Foods</h2> <p>There is a variety of fruits and vegetables that have a rich potassium content and can be easily included in the daily diet.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Hepatitis C is the leading cause for liver diseases in the United States. It is caused by the hepatitis C virus, and is transferred mainly due to unhealthy blood practices.</p> <p>Although the major cause of hepatitis C is the HCV, it can be caused by other factors, including alcohol and different medications. It can also be a offshoot of other diseases. Hepatitis C is one of the six hepatitis virus, A, B, C, D, E, and G. Around 200 million people around the world are infected with it. This infection causes around 10,000 deaths in USA every year. Also, it is the major cause for liver transplants.</p> <p>There are various precautions which may prevent the transfer of the hepatitis C virus in humans. One should refrain from using unsanitary tattoo methods, along with unsanitary piercing and acupuncture. Other than that, one should avoid needle stick injuries, and avoid sharing grooming utensils like toothbrushes, shaving kits, and brushes. One should also refrain from sharing needles, bills, and straws used to inject drugs.</p> <p>Hepatitis C has very few external symptoms, and many people continue living their lives without knowing they have contracted the virus, until the later and more serious stages. The condition has two stages\u2015acute and chronic. Six months after contracting the virus is known as the acute stage. It can be contracted due to many reasons, though the foremost reason still remains blood-blood infection. A person contracts the virus when blood contaminated with HCV enters his or her body. One of the main reasons of such transfusion is tattoos. Other reasons are intravenous drug use and unsafe sex practices.</p> <p>Hepatitis C is largely a non-symptomatic disease. However, in some cases, certain symptoms ascertained to be of hepatitis C emerge in some individuals. The first symptoms to be seen are dark urine, massive tiredness, loss of energy, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. Other symptoms include tenderness of the upper body, yellowish tints in the skin and eyes, and nausea. People with these symptoms may also have liver enzymes twenty times higher than normal levels. Weight loss and aching joints could also occur.</p> <p>Hepatitis C can be treated with antiviral drugs. It can be treated with a combination of pegylated interfron alpha and ribavirin. The treatment may take up to six months to one year. Almost 75% of those affected are cured within six months.</p> <p>If not treated in time, it may become chronic, which in turn may cause chronic liver diseases like liver inflammation, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Treatment during the acute stage has shown almost 90% of cases being cured. The treatment may be difficult for people with a history of alcoholism. The treatment may also cause temporary disability. Some side effects of the treatment are suicidal tendencies, anemia, and cardiovascular issues. Alternative medicines like Licorice and Sylibum marianum can also help in the treatment. These medicines do not necessarily treat the virus, but decrease the liver's duties in bodily functions.</p> <p>Disclaimer: <em>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be replaced for the advice of a medical professional.</em></p>"

It is the most common liver disease worldwide. Also known as the 'silent epidemic', Hepatitis C could have infected a patient for years before actually being discovered. HCV is one of the strains of the Hepatitis virus whose list goes from A through G.</p> <p>The Hepatitis C virus attacks the liver. It keeps on multiplying, killing the surrounding tissue. The immune system fights back, usually causing reactions such as inflammation and fibrosis of the liver. If not detected and treated in time, it could lead to liver cancer or cirrhosis.</p> <p>It is estimated that approximately 1.8 percent of the American population is infected by HCV which is a major cause of chronic liver diseases including liver cancer and cirrhosis. Almost 80 percent of those infected by HCV will develop chronic infection.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Hair fall causes great distress to almost everyone facing it. They resort to almost anything which includes visiting quacks to get their hair back. Hair transplant surgery is a permanent solution to a receding hairline, but make sure to visit a qualified and reputed hair transplant surgeon.</p> <h3>About Hair Loss</h3> <p>The normal person will shed in between 50 to 150 hair every day. The hair that is shed is constantly replaced by new hair in the same follicle which will grow approximately half an inch every month.</p> <p>Baldness begins to appear when the growth of hair does not keep up with shedding. It will also be noticed when the new hair is thinner than the shed hair.</p> <p>Loss of hair will always have a cause. The cause can be diagnosed and a treatment recommended by a hair transplant surgeon. It is commonly misunderstood that only males suffer from hair fall. Females too suffer from hair loss but the frequency is far lesser than that of males.</p> <p>Hair loss can occur due to a variety of reasons, hereditary being the most common. Other causes include regular intake of antihypertensive drugs, diabetes, medical treatments such as chemotherapy, and scalp infections that are left untreated.</p> <h3>Diagnosing Hair Loss</h3> <p>Hair transplant surgery can help replace lost hair. Most of those who suffer hair loss and balding usually have got just one thing in mind; to get the lost hair back for which they can go to any extent. Many quacks have found this to be a very quick way of making money. Many advertisements claim to grow back lost hair no matter how they were lost. This is where you should be careful; never go to just about anybody claiming that they can get your lost hair back.</p> <p>Visit only a renowned hair transplant specialist. If required a sample of your hair will be sent for an analysis to diagnose the exact cause of hair loss. Fortunately, most of the cases of hair fall are treatable by medical hair transplant and restoration surgery, performed by a professionally qualified hair transplant surgeon.</p> <p>There are a very few cases when hair transplant will be useless; the transplanted hair will not grow. If such is the case, the surgeon will let you know, and also suggest an alternate remedy.</p> <h3>What is Hair Transplant Surgery?</h3> <p>Hair transplant is a permanent solution of restoring lost hair. Earlier, the procedure was a complex and painful one. Better understanding of hair problems and an advancement in the equipment used, have helped make this procedure pretty accurate and simple, provided it is done by an experienced hair surgeon.</p> <p>What hair transplant surgery can be described as is hair from a donor area is removed and transplanted onto the balding patch. A donor area is an area that contains healthy hair follicles that do not shed and is located on the back and sides of the head. Those who can undergo hair transplant surgery with good success are those that have healthy donor hair.</p> <h3>Techniques Used</h3> <p>Hair transplant surgery has improved tremendously over the past few decades, especially since the last decade.</p> <p>Single hair grafting, micro grafting, and mini grafting have replaced all previous techniques. These three are variable sized hair grafts, and using the latest equipment along with an experienced hair surgeon will help restore hair almost like it was before going bald.</p> <p>Single hair grafting are single hair follicles that will be transplanted. These hair are fine and soft and will not provide total density. They are used to create the soft hairline which will lead on to thicker hair. The hair surgeon will need to create a hairline. This is a very difficult task and requires a lot of artistic skill and experience.</p> <p>Micro grafting are grafts that contain 2 to 3 hair and will be placed just behind the hairline containing the single hair grafts. This will help in slightly increasing the density.</p> <p>Mini grafting are grafts that contain 4 to 6 hair and will be placed behind the micro grafts. They will have the highest density.\u00a0<span>This pattern will help the hair blend perfectly giving it a natural look.</span></p> <h3>Patient Comfort and Side Effects of the Surgery</h3> <p>Today, with the help of modern, precise, and advanced equipment, hair transplant surgery is not as uncomfortable as it was a few years ago. There are a few minor side effects that may include some pain and an uncomfortable feeling just after the surgery. In rare cases there could be a temporary slight swelling over the area of surgery which can go down till the eyes. Formation of scabs over the area of surgery happen to some, and this is resolved within a few days.</p> <p>More severe problems consisting of infection, scarring, and bleeding are almost unheard of today.</p> <p>To make sure that you have a perfect hair transplant with minimum side effects, always consult a qualified and reputed hair transplant surgeon.</p> <h3>After the Surgery</h3> <p>Normally a hair transplant surgery should take approximately 2 to 6 hours, depending on the amount of hair to be transplanted. At times you may require the head to be bandaged. This is temporary and is removed the following day.</p> <p>Using the latest equipment combined with an experienced hair surgeon, the bandage should never be required. Many today have a hair transplant done in the morning, and are back to work by afternoon.</p> <p>What you must keep in mind is that hair takes time to grow. Don't expect a thick bush of hair to grow instantly where it was transplanted. Actual growth should start around the third month. Full results can be seen in about a year's time.</p> <p>The good news is that the transplanted hair requires absolutely no special maintenance and will grow for a long time to come.</p>"

In such circumstances, being aware of the symptoms of black mold poisoning (and the steps that are to be taken in case of mold infestation) can be of a great help.</p> <p>Have you ever observed a fuzzy black coating on your bathroom and bedroom walls? This can be caused by toxic black mold or mildew. Thriving in wet and humid environment, the toxic fungi cover the walls and other surfaces in a powdery black substance. Black mold is present everywhere around us, outdoors as well as indoors.<br><br>At home, the mold can be easily seen on the walls, ceilings, clothing, furniture, carpets, food and other places, if it is present. It can also flourish on equipment that we use everyday, like air conditioners. The mold which appears as fuzzy blotches of yellow, black, green and red are often associated with an unpleasant odor as well. While it may look unsightly and smell horrible, the real danger of this fungi lies in the toxins that it releases.<br><br><strong>What is Toxic Black Mold?</strong><br><br>Black mold, also known as Stachybotrys chartarum or Stachybotrys atra, is toxigenic in nature. This means that the mold by itself is not toxic, rather it produces certain toxic substances known as mycotoxins. Unlike common indoor molds like Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Alternaria, the Stachybotrys chartarum mold is not so commonly found indoors. However, when it is present in our surroundings, this mold releases the toxic spores mycotoxins. Exposure to these toxic spores in the air that we breathe and contaminated food we eat can cause black mold poisoning. The Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) released from the mold spores lead to fungal infections, allergies, hypersensitivity, allergic asthma, sinus congestion, and other respiratory and nervous system disorders.<br><br><strong>Black Mold Poisoning Symptoms</strong><br><br>The severity of the poisoning symptoms depends on the exposure time and quantity of spores that an individual is exposed to. Younger children, people with a weak immune system, and the elderly people can suffer more from these severe black mold poisoning symptoms. Even otherwise, healthy individuals can suffer from some of the obvious symptoms of black mold poisoning, like allergic reactions of the respiratory and/or the nervous system. Other than these, the symptoms range from chronic fatigue and reddening of the eyes to infertility and miscarriage. The most common symptoms of black mold poisoning are:</p> <p><div><strong>Black Mold and Respiratory Problems</strong></div>n<br><span>One of the most common signs of black mold poisoning are respiratory issues. Exposure to the mold spores in the air can lead to labored breathing, wheezing, chest congestion, increased production of mucus, chronic coughing, and frequent respiratory tract illnesses. A person may experience a burning sensation in the throat or suffer from nosebleeds as well.</span><br><br>n<div><strong>Black Mold Induced Allergies</strong></div>n<br><span>Mold can invade the human system and result in a number of allergies, especially if an individual has an overly-sensitive immune system. The mold develops hyphae, which are small spores containing appendages. The air containing this mold, when inhaled, can lead to a number of allergic reactions. Some of the common signs of allergic reactions caused by mold include:</span>n<ul>n<li>Runny nose</li>n<li>Watery red eyes</li>n<li>Coughing</li>n<li>Itchy nose and throat</li>n</ul>n<span>If a person already suffers from asthma, then the mold allergy can trigger off asthmatic symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Food allergies and stomach ulcers are also quite common when one is exposed to mold for a long time.</span><br><br>n<div><strong>Black Mold and Nervous System Disorders</strong></div>n<br><span>Mold toxicity leads to the production of PEA and glutamate. These brain chemicals produces electrifying brain signals that leads to an over electrified nervous system. This is one of the key reasons for insomnia, anxiety attacks, panic disorder and bipolar disorder in individuals exposed to toxic black mold for a long period. Immune system disorders, caused by the release of Chloral Hydrate which is a sedative that fights the black mold toxins, can lead to weakness, headaches, lethargy, drowsiness, aches and pains especially around the muscle, chest, joints and abdominal areas. In some cases fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea symptoms can also be observed.</span><br><br>n<div><strong>Black Mold and Skin Troubles</strong></div>n<br><span>The toxins released by black mold can enter the body through the skin and cause skin rashes. Dermatitis, which can be identified by rashes, hives blisters, skin inflammation can be caused by black mold poisoning.</span><br><br>n<div><strong>Black Mold and Circulatory System Disorders</strong></div>n<br><span>Mycotoxins present in black mold when breathed in or ingested can make their way to a person's blood stream and cause a number of circulatory system disorders. Hemorrhaging, blood clotting, irregular heartbeat, and low blood pressure are some common circulatory system disorders caused by mold toxicity.</span><br><br>n<div><strong>Black Mold Poisoning during Pregnancy</strong></div>n<br><span>Pregnant women have to watch out for the signs of black mold poisoning. This is because black mold is teratogenic which means it can cause developmental impairment and birth defects if the fetus is exposed to the toxins during pregnancy. Although there are no studies to attest to this fact but black mold toxicity is also linked to infertility and miscarriage.</span><br><br>n<div><strong>Other Symptoms of Black Mold Poisoning</strong></div>n<br><span>Toxic black mold exposure and poisoning can lead to many other health problems. These include:</span>n<ul>n<li>Vision troubles</li>n<li>Eye inflammation</li>n<li>Blurry vision</li>n<li>Ringing in the ears</li>n<li>Hearing loss</li>n<li>Sensitivity to sound</li>n<li>Bad taste in the mouth</li>n<li>Weight loss and hair loss</li>n<li>Infections of urinary tract</li>n<li>Problems in urination</li>n<li>Pain in liver and other internal organs</li>n</ul>n<span>On re-exposure to toxic molds, a person can suffer from anaphylaxis which is a life-threatening allergic reaction to the toxins.</span></p> <h3>What are Signs of Mold?</h3> <p><br><br><span>You can detect the growth of toxic mold within your house or building by looking out for some telltale signs of the same. These telltale signs of mold growth, which range from formation of greenish-black colored patches on the walls to increasing instances of health issues in people occupying the 'said' structure, are discussed below.</span><br><br><span>\u27aa</span><span> </span><b>Moisture on the Surfaces:</b><span> Moisture or dampness on surfaces (of wall, wood, clothes, etc.) can be treated as the very first sign of mildew growth. While moisture does not necessarily indicate the presence of mold, it is an important condition for mold formation and growth. If you reside in a region wherein Relative Humidity (RH) exceeds 55 percent, you but obviously need to keep an eye for mold infestation in your home.</span><br><br><span>\u27aa</span><span> </span><b>Stains on the Wall:</b><span> Yellowish stains on the wall caused due to moisture help initial growth of mold. You need to look out for the greenish, blackish or brownish-colored patches on the damp wall as these patches characterize mold growth on the walls. Other than these black damp spores on walls, cracked or peeling paint can also be a sign of the presence of mold.</span><br><br><span>\u27aa</span><span> </span><b>Unusual Odor:</b><span> Mildew or musty odors is one of the most prominent signs of mold growth on surfaces. At times, you may only experience this 'unusual' smell when your air conditioner or HVAC system is on. If that is the case, you will have the check the particular equipment for mold growth as it usually happens when mold forms within the equipment. If you experience any unusual odor near damp/humid surfaces, you should look out for the other signs of mold growth.</span><br><br><span>\u27aa</span><span> </span><b>Respiratory System Response in People:</b><span> If one or more people occupying the structure experience some kind of allergic reaction or respiratory problem when they are indoors, then there is a possibility of high mold growth. Again this is just one of the several signs, and you need to look out for other signs to ascertain the presence of mold within the house.</span><br><br><span>Poisoning due to the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) formed by the mold is one of the most prominent signs of potential mold growth. After mold formation, it needs nutrition to grow, which it obtains by degrading the surface on which it is growing. During the process of degrading the surface for nutrition, the black mold on the wall contributes to the formation of VOCs. High exposure to VOCs formed by mold can affect human respiratory and central nervous systems, and even cause irritation to mucous membranes.</span></p> <h3>How Can Toxic Mold be Controlled?</h3> <p><span>As mentioned earlier, molds are ubiquitous in nature, that is they are found everywhere - including your home and workplace, and hence it is nearly impossible to get rid of them. However, it is possible to control the growth of mold on surfaces by taking some precautionary measures which ensure that the conditions hospitable for mold growth don't occur in the first place. Discussed below are some simple measures which will help you do away with mold, and the health hazards they pose.</span>n<ul>n<li>Moisture is one of the most important factors when it comes to mold growth, and thus the best way to keep a check on mold growth is to keep a check on the humidity levels within your home.</li>n<li>Dehumidification as and when required can help you keep a check on the humidity levels, while monitoring Relative humidity will help you find out when you will need to dehumidify your building/house.</li>n<li>If there is any water leakage/intrusion, pipe leak, roof leak, condensation problem, etc., it should be promptly repaired.</li>n<li>You will have to ensure that the air conditioners, HVAC systems, and air/ventilation ducts are clean, as the mold formed in these systems usually goes unnoticed and therefore is more dangerous. Drip fans in the air conditioner needs to be checked regularly to avoid the mold growth.</li>n<li>Bathrooms are the most prone places for mold formation and growth, and therefore you should clean the tiles, curtains and appliances inside the bathroom regularly to avoid mold infestation. Venting fans in the bathroom can help in keeping it clean and dry.</li>n<li>Use of air purifiers to cleanse the air inside your house is yet another option to tackle mold infestation as these air purifiers help in reducing the airborne particles of mold spores.</li>n<li>Bleach water is a good way of cleaning the mold in a small space. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water and use it to scrub away the mold. Remember to wear protective clothing and goggles while doing so as the bleach can damage your hands.</li>n<li>You can also resort to some paints/anti-mold products available in the market as these products can resist moisture to a certain extent, and help in prevention of mold. Hiring professional help for mold removal is also advisable.</li>n</ul>n<span>In conclusion, it is very important to monitor the humidity levels in your surroundings and take necessary precautions to make sure that you don't provide haven for molds by leaving damp corners in your house. If you live in some area wherein high humidity levels prevail, then you need to keep an eye for black mold growth and health hazards associated with it.</span><br><br><span>Disclaimer: </span><i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only.

Though the use of this drug can help treat several ailments, certain side effects may also be experienced by the user. The following write-up provides information on prednisone side effects that are associated with its short-term and long-term use.</p> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/topic/1713/1200-1713-prednisone-photo2.jpg\"></a> </div> <p>Prednisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that is used to treat a variety of medical conditions such as asthma, severe allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease, adrenocortical insufficiency, multiple sclerosis, rheumatic disorders, lupus, nephrotic syndrome, myasthenia gravis, etc. This drug has almost the same effect like that of the naturally-occurring corticosteroid hormones. Though it is a very potent glucocorticoid, its use has been associated with certain side effects. When it comes to the severity of the side effects, the dosage, frequency, and the duration for which this drug is taken are some of the determining factors.</p> <p><strong>Mechanism of Action</strong></p> <p>Prednisone is produced by dehydrogenation of cortisone. It is biologically inert. Once this synthetic corticosteroid is administered either orally or via an intramuscular/intravenous injection, the liver turns it into an active metabolite called prednisolone. Prednisolone binds to the glucocorticoid receptors, thereby suppressing the immune response. This makes it very useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions. It is also a fast-acting drug as it is rapidly absorbed. Its effects can be observed in a couple of hours. The usual adult dose at the beginning of treatment ranges from 5-80 mg per day. The initial dose and the maintenance dose would vary, depending on the medical condition for which the person is being treated. For children who are older than 18 months, the initial dosage may be within 0.5-2 mg per kilogram of body weight if the child is showing signs of inflammation or an immune response. The dosage may be higher for serious conditions such as asthma or nephrotic syndrome.</p> <p><strong>Side Effects of Prednisone </strong><br>Though there have been reports of serious side effects owing to larger doses and long-term use of this drug, some of the users may experience adverse effects even on taking this drug for a period of less than three weeks. Side effects could also occur due to drug interactions. Here are some of the common side effects of prednisolone that are associated with short-term use:</p> <p>\u25ba Insomnia<br>\u25ba Mood changes<br>\u25ba Headaches<br>\u25ba Upset stomach</p> <p>The use of prednisone can affect many organ systems of the body. Here are some of the common side effects of prednisone that are associated with its long-term use:</p> <p><strong>Effects on the Skin</strong></p> <p>The long-term use of this drug could affect the skin. Here are the skin changes that could occur due to glucocorticoid therapy:</p> <p>\u25ba Easy bruising<br>\u25ba Excessive sweating<br>\u25ba Slow healing of wounds<br>\u25ba Hirsutism (excessive hair growth)<br>\u25ba Stretch marks<br>\u25ba Acne</p> <p><strong>Effects on the Musculoskeletal System</strong></p> <p>The risk of the following conditions may increase with the prolonged use of prednisone:</p> <p>\u25ba Osteoporosis<br>\u25ba Long bone fractures<br>\u25ba Myalgia<br>\u25ba Rupturing of the tendons</p> <p><strong>Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract</strong></p> <p>Long-term use of this synthetic glucocorticoid hormone could also affect the process of digestion and may cause the following side effects:</p> <p>\u25ba Nausea<br>\u25ba Indigestion<br>\u25ba Abdominal pain<br>\u25ba Increased appetite<br>\u25ba Weight gain</p> <p><strong>Effects on the Eyes</strong></p> <p>Temporary impairment of vision has been reported in case of people who have been taking this drug for some time. The risk of secondary infections caused by viruses or fungi may also increase with long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Other adverse effects include:</p> <p>\u25ba Increased intraocular pressure<br>\u25ba Glaucoma<br>\u25ba Cataract</p> <p><strong>Effects on the Electrolyte Balance</strong></p> <p>Electrolyte balance is essential for proper functioning of the body. Steroid therapy could hamper this balance, thereby giving rise to the following:</p> <p>\u25ba Elevated blood pressure<br>\u25ba Fluid retention<br>\u25ba Retention of sodium<br>\u25ba Loss of potassium</p> <p><strong>Effects on the Nervous System</strong></p> <p>It is believed that the prolonged use of steroids could induce mental changes. Some of the effects that are linked to the use of prednisone include:</p> <p>\u25ba Mood swings<br>\u25ba Restlessness<br>\u25ba Confusion<br>\u25ba Depression<br>\u25ba Insomnia</p> <p><strong>Effects on the Endocrine System</strong></p> <p>Long-term use of prednisone can also affect the endocrine system. Here are some of the side effects:</p> <p>\u25ba Cushing's syndrome<br>\u25ba High blood sugar<br>\u25ba Glucose intolerance<br>\u25ba Adrenal suppression</p> <p>The user may become dependent on the drug owing to its prolonged use. This is the reason why doctors do not recommend suddenly stopping the dose, especially when the patient has taken it for more than a week. They reduce the dose gradually over a few days in the case of short-term use, and over weeks or months in case of long-term treatment. If the drug is stopped abruptly, symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, joint pain, and body aches might be experienced by the user. Prolonged use may lead to adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the body no longer produces sufficient amounts of adrenal steroid hormones.</p> <p><strong>Adverse Drug Interactions</strong></p> <p>Certain drugs can interact with prednisone, therefore the patient must inform their doctor about pre-existing medical conditions, and the drugs he/she has been taking as a part of their treatment.</p> <p>\u25ba Diuretics (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, furosemide and thiazides)<br>\u25ba Antacids<br>\u25ba Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<br>\u25ba Anticonvulsant drugs<br>\u25ba Drugs for diabetes<br>\u25ba Estrogen<br>\u25ba Anticoagulants<br>\u25ba Antifungal medication<br>\u25ba Live-virus vaccines</p> <p>If you are a prednisone user, do inform your doctor on experiencing any of the aforementioned side effects. Reducing the dosage gradually is the best way to prevent these adverse effects. Doctors could also follow a symptomatic approach. These are situations where doctors have to weigh the disadvantages of using a drug against the advantages and make an informed decision. One must remember that while prednisone definitely does give rise to many side effects, it is also a life-saving drug.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>The information provided in this article is solely for educating the reader.

In fact, low potassium or hypokalemia can turn out to be fatal at times, and therefore it is very important to monitor potassium levels in the body, and replenish it, if found to be deficient.</p> <p>Potassium is required by our body for smooth muscular and cellular functioning, cardiovascular functioning, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, for the conversion of glucose into glycogen and muscle building, etc. It is a natural diuretic as it helps in excreting excess amount of sodium from the body through urine. Potassium plays a very important role in maintaining fluid levels, electrolyte balance and pH level of the body. The most important functions of potassium in the human body are to keep blood pressure under control and help in intracellular nutrient transfer. It also helps in keeping acne, allergies, fatigue, kidney stones, etc., at bay.</p> <p>Potassium plays an important role of a catalyst for many types of enzymes inside the human body. In other words, it helps in spawning many important chemical reactions. It is also believed to help in improving ATP hydrolysis. With so many important body functions to its credit, potassium is no doubt important for our overall health, such that if it is not present in sufficient amount it can hamper these body functions and result in adverse effects on our health.</p> <p><div><strong>Effects of Low Potassium on the Body</strong></div>n<br>The medical condition in which our body fails to retain the amount of potassium required for its day-to-day functioning leading to low levels of potassium in blood is called hypokalemia. It may prove to be fatal considering it has a crucial role to play in various body functions, all of which are bound to be affected by the alterations of the levels of this mineral in the body. While blood potassium level in the range of 3.6 to 5.2 mmol/L (millimoles per liter) is considered normal, potassium level below 2.5 mmol/L is considered to eb critically low, and requires prompt medical attention.</p> <p>The effects of hypokalemia on the body may be very mild to severe. While a person suffering from primary staged hypokalemia may not experiencing anything unusual with the functioning of various organs initially, its effects are bound to get obvious with the severity of the condition. You will get to see the effects of low potassium levels in the body in form of following symptoms:<br><ul><li>Myalgia (muscle pain), muscular weakness and cramps.</li><li>Cardiac arrhythmia i.e. abnormal rate of muscle contractions in the heart.</li><li>Unexplained fatigue and weakness</li><li>Hyponatremia, which may or may not be accompanied by anxiety.</li><li>Impaired nerve transmission and deteriorated nervous system, which, in turn, results in confusion and delirium.</li><li>Tingling and numbness in arms and legs</li><li>Skin related problems such as blistering, skin eruptions, dryness of skin, acne, etc.</li><li>Temporary memory loss or other problems like weak memory, difficulty in concentration, etc.</li><li>Sleeplessness and irritability</li><li>Intestinal or lung paralysis</li><li>Heart related problems, such as heart deterioration.</li><li>It may increase the risk of high blood pressure</li><li>Ringing noise in the ear at times</li><li>Digestive system may also get affected due to this deficiency and this may lead to constipation.</li></ul>Potassium deficiency may also result in hypertension, depression, headache, etc. Critically low levels of potassium is life-threatening as it may cause permanent muscle damage, kidney damage, paralysis, etc.</p> <p><div><strong>What are the Causes of Hypokalemia?</strong></div>n<br>A person is most likely to suffer from this deficiency due to excessive excretion of potassium or due to low potassium intake, both of which, in turn, are attributed to various factors coming into play. Most prominent causes of low potassium in people are:n<ul>n<li>Potassium deficiency due to lack of potassium rich foods in the daily diet, i.e. insufficient potassium consumption.</li>n<li>Excess potassium excretion through bowel motion or urine.</li>n<li>Losing potassium as a result of vomiting, diarrhea or excessive sweating.</li>n<li>Use of medication which can interfere and bring down the potassium levels in the body.</li>n<li>Excessive use of diuretics and laxatives.</li>n<li>Health problems such as diabetic ketoacidosis or chronic kidney failure.</li>n<li>Hereditary defects of renal salt transporters, such as the Gitelman syndrome and the Bartter syndrome</li>n</ul>n<div><strong>Treatment Available for Hypokalemia</strong></div>n<br>If a person is suffering from diarrhea or any other condition which is causing hypokalemia, then he should be treated for the underlying problem so as to stop/regulate potassium loss from his body. At the same time, the physician may also prescribe medication to improve potassium levels in the body. The patient is generally asked to take balanced diet for days in order to restore the physical health pertaining to potassium level and its role in metabolism. Re-hydrating your body will be a good option to bring back the potassium levels to normal. Avoid drinking water, instead have electrolyte solution which contains high potassium which helps in bringing the potassium levels to normal. Basically, the physician will spell out the treatment plan to be followed only after taking the severity of the problem into consideration. In case of excess diarrhea and vomiting for more than 3 days consult a doctor immediately.</p> <p>Prevention is better than cure, and a balanced diet is the key to prevent hypokalemia. You should include foods high in potassium, such as orange, banana, potato, tomato, watermelon, beans, cereals, meat, grapes, milk, yogurt, spinach, dried fruits (peaches, dates, apricots, raisins) etc., in your daily diet to strike that balance in your meal. While potassium supplements are looked upon as the ideal tools to tackle potassium deficiency and low potassium levels in blood, you should only resort to such supplements after consulting your physician.</p> <p><i><b>Disclaimer</b>: This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p> <div class=\"buzzle-masonry-2\"> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/topic/1660/1200-1660-hypokalemia-potassium-deficiency-photo2.jpg\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/topic/1660/1200-1660-hypokalemia-potassium-deficiency-photo3.jpg\"></a> </div></div>"

Stretching and exercising every muscle helps improve blood circulation and prevent cramping.</p> <h3>What is Sciatica?</h3> <p>This is a term that is the cause of much confusion and is often grossly misunderstood. Sciatica is not just a disease or ailment or even a diagnosis by itself that would point to any particular cause of pain, rather it is a set of symptoms. Generally, it is used for any pain that is caused by the irregular compression or nuisance in one or more of the nerves in the lower part of the spinal cord, that make up the sciatic nerve. These can be caused by various different conditions.</p> <p>The medical term for sciatica is radiculopathy, which occurs when a spinal disc in the lower back has been extended beyond what is its normal position, irritating the radicular nerve or the nerve root which is connected to the sciatic nerve, that in turn has its off-shoots snaking its way down into the lower body through the back of the leg. Thus pain is experienced along its path.</p> <h2>Exercises For Sciatica</h2> <p>While we may prefer bed rest to exercise when in pain, active sciatica exercise is the best mechanism for healing sciatica pain. Doctors advise rest to patients for just a day or two after a bout of sciatica but inactivity will only aid in worsening the pain because due to the lack of movement the muscles and spinal structures become further cramped and thus their support of the back weakens leading to back injury and major strain on the muscles and spine which adds to the lower body and back pain.</p> <p>Exercising also keeps the fluids between the discs healthy and well lubricated, also helping with the dispersion of nutrition and strengthening the muscles of the abdomen and back. Exercises for sciatica relief are of many different kinds, depending on the cause of the pain and mostly involve stretching of target specific muscles. Engaging in regular exercise helps to keep these muscles mobile and strengthens them that helps to speed up the recuperation process as well as prevent future such painful incidences.</p> <p><span>A physiotherapist, certified athletic trainer (ATC), chiropractor, physiotherapist or a specialist who treats back and lower body problems can be consulted for sciatica pain relief and exercise should only be done under the supervision of a trained professional. It is very important to get an accurate diagnosis of the cause of the pain, because the exercise program to be recommended rests on that. Though rare, sciatica can also be caused by an infection or tumor that requires serious and immediate medical attention. Here are the major causes of sciatica.</span></p> <p><ul>n<li>Sciatica from a herniated disc</li>n<li>Sciatica from spinal stenosis</li>n<li>Sciatica from degenerative disc disease</li>n<li>Sciatica from isthmic spondylolisthesis</li>n<li>Sciatic pain from piriformis syndrome</li>n<li>Sciatic pain from sacroiliac joint dysfunction</li>n</ul>nThe sciatica exercises for each of these conditions is different and must be done correctly, on a regular basis at least twice a day to obtain optimum results.</p> <h3>Exercises For Herniated Disc Sciatica</h3> <p>It normally causes acute leg pain as the disc protrudes in the incorrect direction or a nerve root is compressed causing pain to radiate along the sciatic nerve. The exercises prescribed for such a problem are ones that need the patient to get into a backwards bending position called <i>extension exercises or press-ups</i> which cause the pain to ease by moving the muscles in the lower extremities upwards and into the lower back.</p> <h3>Exercises For Spinal Stenosis Sciatica</h3> <p>This is caused by nerve root irritation or impinging, which results in the constriction of the nerve's passageway. This pain shoots down the leg while walking or muscle flexing. All exercises that require the patient to bend forward and flex the lower spine help to clear and expand these passages by stabilizing the lower spine thus allowing for the condition to heal.</p> <h3>Exercises For Degenerative Disc Disease Sciatica</h3> <p>When a degenerative disc intrudes on a sciatic nerve in the lower back it is the cause of sciatica. Exercises for lumbar stabilization are prescribed for this kind of sciatica and includes the McKenzie Method. The lumbar spine and pelvic regions are trained using these exercise movements.</p> <h3>Exercises For Isthmic Spondylolisthesis Sciatica</h3> <p>When the N5 nerve root is impinged upon, it is the cause of this kind of sciatica. There are two kinds of exercises that help in this condition; these include flexing and stabilizing that help the lumbar spine to remain stable in a flexed position.</p> <h3>Exercises For Piriformis Syndrome</h3> <p>Experiencing pain along the sciatic nerve is a common symptom of piriformis syndrome. But this syndrome is not really sciatica but a muscle called the piriformis muscle, which lies in proximity to the sciatic nerve itself, irritates it to cause pain. These cause excruciating pain, tingling and numbness, running from the lower back, to the rear and sometimes down the leg and into the foot. Stretching exercises for the piriformis muscle, hamstring muscles and hip extensor muscles helps decrease the painful symptoms.</p> <h3>Exercises For Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction</h3> <p>The inflammation of the SI joint or sacroiliac joint causes this. Therefore this is not true sciatica but the similar symptoms occur and exercise like stretching and movement exercises should be performed to help alleviate the pain.</p> <h3>Exercises For Long Term Sciatica Relief</h3> <p>These exercises must be performed as a part of daily living and not just treated as a means to get rid of back pain. They ensure good spinal health and help to ease the pressures that stress has on us. It is also a must to maintain good posture while performing daily activities and use ergonomically correct furniture to make sure the lower back is well supported and avoid standing or being cramped in the same position for long periods of time.</p> <p>It is essential that you engage in these exercises only under the guidance of a trained medical professional and physiotherapist. Maintaining a good exercise regimen, which stretches and stimulates every muscle of the body and a good posture is the key to preventing muscular pain.</p>"

The sciatic nerve is the longest as well as the largest nerve in the body. The nerve starts at the base of the spinal cord and goes down from the buttocks down into both the legs. The thickness of the nerve can be compared to that of the little finger. There are various causes of the sciatica pain. Most people describe this condition as 'pain running down the leg, especially at the back of the leg'. The most common characteristics of sciatica is the pain, which is felt only on one side in the lower body. Although it is said to be a medical condition, as a matter of fact, it points to another underlying medical problem, which needs to be treated. </p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>The main cause of sciatica is damage caused to the sciatic nerve or due to pressure exerted on the sciatic nerve. Irritation to the sciatic nerve can also cause the condition. Disc herniation in the lumbar region of the spine exerts pressure on the sciatic nerve and give rise to the sciatica. If the sciatic nerve is pinched (which can be caused either due to disc herniation or due to injury), it will be irritated, resulting in inflammation of the nerve. The other causes of sciatica are:</p> <p><ul>n<li>Sitting or standing for an extended period of time</li>n<li>Bad posture</li>n<li>Lack of muscle movement causing the muscles to constrict</li>n<li>Adjoining bone irritating the nerve</li>n<li>Tumors around the sciatic nerve</li>n<li>If pressure is exerted on the sciatic nerve during pregnancy</li>n<li>Internal bleeding around the sciatic nerve</li>n<li>Lumbar spinal stenosis narrowing the spinal canal, which causes sciatic nerve to be compressed.</li>n<li>Piriformis syndrome</li>n<li>Any activity which puts pressure on the spine</li>n<li>Being overweight</li>n<li>Wearing heels for long periods</li>n<li>Slipping of a vertebra over the other, pressurizes the sciatic nerve causing sciatica</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>The most common sign and symptom of sciatica is <b><i>pain in the lower extremities of the body</i></b>. The pain often starts at the base of the spine and routing downwards to the pelvic region, buttocks, thighs, back of the legs and foot. It may be seen that simple and regular day-to-day activities may be hindered because of the pain. The pain may be accompanied by a <b><i>tingling sensation</i></b>. A <b><i>burning sensation</i></b> may be felt along with the pain. <b><i>Numbness</i></b> that can vary in intensity, weakness in the affected leg and difficulty in moving the leg may also be observed. Depending on the condition for some people the condition may be debilitating and severe, while for some people the pain may be intermittent, however there always is the risk of the pain going spiraling.</p> <h3>Sciatica</h3> <p>Sciatica treatment should only be carried out by a trained health professional. The first step in treating sciatica is to find out the root cause of the condition. Depending on the cause of the condition, the line of treatment will differ. In the initial stages, anti-inflammatory and analgesics are given to the patient to suppress the pain and discomfort. Besides anti-inflammatory medication and analgesics, exercise is also prescribed under the care of a physiotherapist, when the condition is not severe.<span>\u00a0</span></p> <p><span><span>As the type of exercise depends on the cause of sciatic pain they must be done after consultation and practiced on a regular basis, twice a day to provide complete relief from pain. Some of the\u00a0<b><i>exercises</i></b>, which prove to be of help in treating the condition are:</span></span>n<ol>n<li>Piriformis stretch</li>n<li>Core strengthening exercises</li>n<li>Hamstring stretches</li>n<li>Downward facing dog</li>n<li>Bridge pose</li>n<li>Lower body twists</li>n</ol></p> <p>Though bed rest may seem like the better option, inactivity results in the muscles degenerating further and exercising them makes them more mobile by boosting circulation and helps to adequately carry the fluids and nutrients across the system. Minding the body posture and avoiding soft surfaces that encourage slouching must be a part of treatment. Being in the same position for long or lifting things puts strains on the spinal cord as well as the muscles in the hips and legs thus such positions must also be avoided.</p> <p>In severe cases of sciatica, operation may be required to treat the condition. Thus, it becomes very important to diagnose the real cause of sciatica in order to rule out the possibility of another serious health ailment which could require immediate attention and/or surgery. It is best to consult a doctor immediately in order to diagnose the problem correctly and ensure that appropriate steps are taken or this could develop into a grave problem.</p> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/topic/8966/1200-8966-oblique-exercises-photo2.jpg\"></a> </div>"

The early symptoms of an HIV infection are flu-like, and may not be observed in all infected individuals. If detected early, the progression of an HIV infection into AIDS can be slowed down through drug therapy, lifestyle changes, and self-care measures. The following HealthHearty write-up provides information on the symptoms of HIV/AIDS.</p> <p><em>The risk of progression of HIV infection into AIDS is very high in the absence of treatment. However, the progression might be very slow or may not occur, in a very small number of affected people. Such people are called nonprogressors.</em> <br><br>The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is an advanced stage of an infection caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This virus binds to the dendritic cells that carry it from the site of infection to the lymph nodes, wherein a viral surface protein called gp120 binds tightly to the CD4 molecules. Another viral protein, p24 forms a casing surrounding HIV's genetic material. HIV attacks the CD4 immune cells, which are the key cells that fight against pathogens and disease-causing agents. Being HIV positive doesn't mean that you have AIDS.<br><br>While many people might not show any signs for years after being infected, some people might exhibit symptoms within 10 days to a few weeks after the exposure to the virus. A person is diagnosed with AIDS, when he/she tests positive for HIV and his/her CD4 cell count is less than 200. The normal range for CD4 immune cells in healthy individuals is around 500 to 1,500 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. The substantial drop in the CD4 count makes one highly susceptible to certain cancers and infections caused by opportunistic pathogens. These conditions are referred to as AIDS-defining illnesses.<br><br>n<div>n<div><span class=\"ct-underline\"><strong>Early Symptoms</strong></span></div>nWhile some of the people exposed to this virus may not show any signs, there are others who experience certain symptoms after 2 to 4 weeks or up to 3 months after exposure to the virus. This phase of acute illness is referred to as the primary HIV infection or acute retroviral syndrome (ARS). This is basically the body's response to the rapid HIV replication. During this phase, the infected person experiences flu-like symptoms. Unfortunately, the affected individuals might consider the illness to be a case of flu. During this phase, the amount of virus circulating in the blood (viral load) is high, which increases the possibility of transmission of the virus considerably, in comparison to the next phase of the infection.<br><br>The risk of transmission of the virus is very high, if the infected person indulges in unprotected sex during this phase. Statistics show that one in five infected persons, is unaware of his/her condition, which is why people in the high-risk groups are often urged to go for HIV screening tests.<br><br>The symptoms of the acute retroviral syndrome include:<br><span>\u279e</span> Fever<br><span>\u279e</span> Chills<br><span>\u279e</span> Night sweats<br><span>\u279e</span> Muscle aches<br><span>\u279e</span> Fatigue<br><span>\u279e</span> Headache<br><span>\u279e</span> Rash<br><span>\u279e</span> Sore throat<br><span>\u279e</span> Mouth ulcers<br><span>\u279e</span> Enlarged lymph nodes<br><br>In case of people affected by ARS, the symptoms might resolve within a few weeks. After the ARS phase, comes the asymptomatic or latency phase, wherein the affected individuals don't experience symptoms for several years.<br><br>Not everyone exposed to the virus gets affected by ARS or the primary HIV infection. In some people, there are no specific symptoms. These people have a clinical latent infection, that may last for a duration of 8 - 10 years or longer. However, some of the people in this phase might have swollen lymph nodes.<br><br>During this asymptomatic period, HIV multiplies fast, thereby destroying the immune cells.<br><br>n<div><strong><u>Early Symptomatic HIV infection</u></strong></div>nInfected individuals begin to experience symptoms as the immune system weakens. As the virus destroys immune cells, the infected individuals begin to develop mild infections, and experience symptoms such as:<br><span>\u279e</span> Fever<br><span>\u279e</span> Fatigue<br><span>\u279e</span> Swollen lymph nodes<br><span>\u279e</span> Diarrhea<br><span>\u279e</span> Unexplained weight loss<br><span>\u279e</span> Cough and shortness of breath<br><span>\u279e</span> Progression of the HIV infection to AIDS<br><br>In the absence of treatment, the disease can progress to AIDS in a few years. By the time AIDS develops, one's immune system has been severely damaged, thereby increasing the risk of opportunistic infections or diseases that wouldn't affect a person with a healthy immune system. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include:<br><span>\u279e</span> Soaking night sweats<br><span>\u279e</span> Shaking chills<br><span>\u279e</span> Fever that lasts for more than 10 days<br><span>\u279e</span> Cough and shortness of breath<br><span>\u279e</span> Diarrhea<br><span>\u279e</span> Nausea<br><span>\u279e</span> Vomiting<br><span>\u279e</span> Sores on the tongue or in the mouth<br><span>\u279e</span> Headaches<br><span>\u279e</span> Persistent, unexplained fatigue<br><span>\u279e</span> Vision-related problems<br><span>\u279e</span> Weight loss<br><span>\u279e</span> Skin rashes<br><span>\u279e</span> Easy bruising<br><span>\u279e</span> Genital sores<br><span>\u279e</span> Oral thrush<br><span>\u279e</span> Joint pain<br><br>n<div><strong><u>Transmission of HIV</u></strong></div>nThis virus can get transmitted to others through sexual contact, or direct contact with the infected blood in case of a blood transfusion. Having unprotected sex with multiple sex partners or indulging in other risky behavior like sharing a drug-injecting syringe can put a person at a greater risk. Sexual intercourse is the most common method of the transmission. During sexual contact, HIV can enter a body through the lining of vagina, penis, rectum, or mouth. Although there is no evidence of HIV being spread by saliva, there are possibilities of contact with blood through cuts or sores in mouth.<br><br>HIV can spread from one person to other through the sharing of infected needles that carry a small amount of blood. Transmission could occur through blood transfusions, if there is any negligence during the transfusion process.<br><br>An infected woman can transmit the virus to her unborn child during pregnancy. The risk of transmission of the virus from the mother to the unborn child can be lowered, if the mother takes the anti-HIV drug called zidovudine during pregnancy. The risk is further reduced if the delivery is done by Cesarean section. Breastfeeding can also cause the virus to spread from an infected mother to the child.<br><br>HIV can only be transmitted through intimate contact with infected blood or body fluids. Some of the ways in which HIV does not spread include touching or hugging, contact with sweat, tear, or respiratory secretions of an infected person, sharing household items like utensils, towels, bedding, sharing facilities like swimming pools, saunas, hot tubs or toilets, etc.</div>n<br>There is no cure for HIV. As the CD4 (T-cells) count continues to drop and the immune system weakens further, affected individuals may continue to experience the aforementioned symptoms and develop new ones as well. However, following the guidelines given by the doctors can help in improving the health, and slowing the progression of HIV to AIDS. It goes without saying that risky behavior that increases the risk of HIV/AIDS must be avoided, and measures should be followed to prevent this deadly disease.<br><br><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>The information provided in this article is solely for educating the reader.

Prolonged asbestos exposure can have a lot of damaging health effects which in certain cases prove fatal.</p> <p>Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral which was widely used in many commercial products for its properties of resistance to heat and chemicals, flexibility, and strength. Asbestos is divided into two main groups - serpentine and amphibole. Chrysotile comes under the serpentine group. Actinolite, anthophylite, amosite, crocidolite and tremolite all come under the amphibole group.</p> <p>Asbestos was widely used from the 1940s right through the 80's. Regulations regarding the use of asbestos came into effect only from the mid 70's, and became more stringent in the 90's.</p> <p>Asbestos fibers when dry, can easily get dispersed in the air. Inhalation of these microscopic fibers have serious health effects, which will not show immediately. It could take anywhere between 15 to 40 years or more for the symptoms to surface.</p> <p>Since regulations didn't exist a few decades ago, or were not as stringent as they are today, asbestos exposure then was very high. People at maximum risk of high asbestos inhalation were those involved in the following occupations:<br /><span>--\u00a0</span>Mine workers<br />-- Those working in asbestos-cement manufacturing plants<br />-- Construction workers<br />-- Plumbers and electricians<br />-- Those involved in renovation of old constructions<br />-- Those working in the auto clutch and brake manufacturing industry<br />-- Auto mechanics (especially those who service clutch and brake assemblies)<br />-- Those involved in ship building<br />-- Those involved in ship breaking for scrap</p> <h2>Health Effects of Asbestos Exposure</h2> <p>-- Asbestosis<br>-- Mesothelioma<br>-- Lung Cancer</p> <h3>Asbestosis</h3> <p>Asbestosis is a chronic and restrictive lung disease. It is caused by inhalation of asbestos particles over prolonged periods of time. Asbestosis takes approximately 15 to 20 years to show its effects.</p> <p>The inhaled asbestos fibers initially damage the cell membranes in the lungs, causing the lung tissues to harden and form scars. This is known as fibrosis.</p> <p>During the initial stages of the disease only the outer lung tissues get scarred, but as the disease progresses, it affects the entire lungs. The hardening of lung tissues make breathing difficult, thus reducing the oxygen intake. Pressure on the lungs increases because of its inability to remove carbon dioxide and replace it with fresh oxygen. This is the reason it is known as a restrictive lung disease.</p> <p>Persons suffering from asbestosis are more prone to develop bronchitis and pneumonia.</p> <p>Symptoms of Asbestosis may include one or more of the following.<br />-- Shortness of breath<br />-- Difficulty in breathing<br />-- Constant dry cough<br />-- Constant pain in the chest<br />-- Pulmonary hypertension<br />-- Excess phlegm</p> <h3>Mesothelioma</h3> <p>Mesothelioma is a cancer of the pleura (lung lining). Past documented records show that mesothelioma is caused mainly by the inhalation of the crocidolite and amosite variety of asbestos.</p> <p>Mesothelioma takes approximately 30 to 40 years to develop and show its effects. It is one of the most fatal, aggressive and painful cancers, almost always leading to death.</p> <p>Mesothelioma is mostly restricted to the lungs, but in rare instances it can also occur in the peritoneum (abdominal cavity) in cases where the asbestos fibers reach the stomach or bowel.</p> <p>Symptoms of Mesothelioma may include one or more of the following.<br />-- Shortness of breath which keeps on increasing as the disease progresses.<br />-- Extreme difficulty in breathing due to lung compression caused by the disease.<br />-- Constant pain in the chest which ranges from mild to severe pain.<br />-- Unexplained sudden abdominal swelling and pain.<br />-- Unexplained weight loss.</p> <h3>Lung Cancer</h3> <p>Cancer of the lung, bronchial tubes and alveoli are the effect of constant long-term asbestos exposure.</p> <p>Individuals exposed to asbestos who smoke as well, are at the highest risk of developing lung cancer wherein the combination of asbestos and cigarette smoke in the lungs, increases the chances of developing the disease.</p> <p>Symptoms of lung cancer may include one or more of the following.<br />-- Dry, irritating cough<br />-- Increase in sputum production<br />-- Blood mixed with sputum<br />-- Chest pain<br />-- Lung infection</p> <h3>Get Medical Help Immediately</h3> <p>If you have been exposed to asbestos over the past few decades, chances are that the signs and symptoms of asbestos related disease could show up anytime now. If you notice any of the above mentioned symptoms, do not wait for them to subside naturally. Seek medical advice immediately. If an asbestos related disease is detected, you may not live a perfectly normal life, but taking prescribed medication immediately will not only prolong, but possibly even save your life.</p>"

The following article provides information regarding the same.</p> <p>Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral, which is classified in subgroups of chrysotile and amphibole. Amphiboles have got straight, needle-like fibers and are considered more hazardous than chrysotiles. Amphiboles consist of actinolite, anthophylite, amosite, crocidolite, and tremolite asbestos.</p> <p>Short-term exposure to asbestos usually occurs when the person is not occupationally involved in handling asbestos. For example, someone who is renovating their home could be exposed to asbestos fibers from old insulation, roofing, and tiles for the duration of renovation which could last from a couple of weeks to a few months.</p> <h3>Difference Between Short-term and Long-term Asbestos Exposure</h3> <p>Long-term asbestos exposure is almost always likely to cause an asbestos-related disease. The risk of disease in short-term exposure is present, but not as much as in long-term exposure. This will also depend on the amount of asbestos fibers inhaled. The risk for short-term and long-term asbestos inhalation could be the same if the short-term inhalation consists of hazardous amounts of asbestos fibers and if constant long-term inhalation consists of negligible amounts of asbestos fibers.</p> <h2>Possible Diseases Due to Exposure</h2> <p>Low levels of short-term exposure to asbestos is not considered a threat to humans and can generally be overlooked. You should be concerned of the effects of exposure when the duration has been short, but the amount of asbestos fibers inhaled were way over limits. Especially, during renovation of a house or ship breaking, even the microscopic particles could form a cloud of asbestos fibers and be inhaled by you. This is a cause of concern, and you should get medical attention as soon as possible. Following are the most common diseases that can be caused due to short-term, high level inhalation of asbestos fibers:n<ul>n<li>Asbestosis</li>n<li>Lung Cancer</li>n<li>Mesothelioma</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Asbestosis</h3> <p><span>Asbestosis is caused when excess asbestos fibers get firmly lodged in the lungs and cause fibrosis/lung scarring. Following are some symptoms caused by asbestosis:</span>n<ul>n<li>Shortness of breath</li>n<li>Difficulty in breathing</li>n<li>Constant dry cough</li>n<li>Constant pain in the chest</li>n<li>Pulmonary hypertension</li>n<li>Excess phlegm</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Lung cancer</h3> <p><span>Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of long-term exposure and could occur in a high level short-term exposure too. Following are some symptoms caused by lung cancer:</span>n<ul>n<li>Dry, irritating cough</li>n<li>Increased sputum production</li>n<li>Blood mixed with sputum</li>n<li>Chest pain</li>n<li>Lung infection</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Mesothelioma</h3> <p><span>Mesothelioma is a very rare form of cancer of the thin membranes surrounding the lungs/abdomen. Following are some symptoms caused by Mesothelioma:</span>n<ul>n<li>Shortness of breath that keeps on increasing as the disease progresses</li>n<li>Difficulty in breathing due to lung compression caused by the disease</li>n<li>Constant pain in the chest which ranges from mild to severe pain</li>n<li>Unexplained sudden abdominal swelling and pain</li>n<li>Unexplained weight loss</li>n</ul></p> <p>The symptoms of diseases related to asbestos inhalation will not show up immediately as they usually taking approximately 15 to 40 years to develop. If you know that you have been exposed to a high levels of asbestos fibers over a short term, do not just pass it off. It could possibly be developing into an irreversible cancer. Any disease related to asbestos inhalation can cause other serious ailments, and at times even result in death. Therefore, consult a health care professional immediately for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

This may be the most important action that you can take to improve your health and decrease your risk of cancer.<span>\u275e</span><br>n<div>\u2015 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)</div>n</div>n<br>From the late 1800s until late 1900s, asbestos was being used at a great scale in various industries. However, after understanding its fatal effects, its use was prohibited. In 1989, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had imposed a ban on all 'new uses' of asbestos. However, the uses developed before 1989, are still allowed. Nonetheless, it was only due to these substantial efforts that the domestic consumption of asbestos was found to be significantly dropped to 2,400 metric tons by 2005, where it amounted to about 803,000 metric tons in 1973.</p> <p>Millions of people have been exposed to this harmful substance during the past few decades. Those involved in manufacturing asbestos products, shipbuilding trades, construction and demolition, and the like, are affected the most. Interestingly, it was found that those who were a part of the rescue, recovery, and maintenance of the World Trade Center (WTC) post the 9/11 attacks, were exposed to asbestos to a great degree. Because this mineral group was used in the WTC construction, the atmosphere consisted of a heavy amount of asbestos, post the attack. Not only the workers, but also those living near the site were at a great risk. Because the symptoms take several decades\u2015anywhere between 10 to 40 years\u2015there is a possibility that they may not have shown up as yet. However, that does not negate the possibility of being affected.</p> <p><div><strong>An Overview of Asbestos-related Diseases and their Treatment</strong></div>n<br>When a person is constantly subjected to the inhalation of asbestos fibers over long time periods, he or she is likely to develop diseases affecting the lungs. The health hazards due to a chronic exposure include lung cancer, asbestosis, mesothelioma, and certain pleural abnormalities. Certain non-respiratory cancers have also been linked with asbestos exposure, however, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate this speculation. The following sections give you an overview of the different health complications attributed to asbestos, and the treatment measures that are likely to be administered. <span>Note, there is no cure for health problems resulting from asbestos exposure. However, treatment proves to be efficacious in relieving symptoms, preventing further complications, and slowing the progression of the condition</span>.</p> <p><div><strong>Asbestosis</strong></div>n<br><span>\u27a6</span><b>Definition</b>: Asbestosis is a chronic and restrictive lung disease that causes scarring of the lung tissue due to inhalation of asbestos particles over a prolonged period of time. It takes about 15 to 20 years (or more) to show its symptoms, which include, shortness of breath, chest pain, excessive phlegm formation, and dry cough.</p> <p>\u27a6Treatment: There is currently no total cure for this condition. Treatment of asbestosis begins with ending exposure to all lung irritants. A combination of therapy, follow-up care, medication, and surgery is required to keep the complications at bay.<br>n<ul>n<li>Annual administration of flu and pneumococcal vaccinations are a part of the routine care for these patients.</li>n<li>As this condition causes extreme breathing problems, the use of supplemental oxygen is prescribed.</li>n<li>Medications may be prescribed to minimize the discomfort arising from certain symptoms such as pain, constipation, cough, etc.</li>n<li>Surgical measures may be opted in case of an extreme situation, such as the need of a lung transplant.</li>n<li>The healthcare specialist will ask to completely quit smoking as soon as possible, and also to stay away from any lung irritants that may worsen the condition.</li>n<li>Regular tests including chest X-rays and lung function tests will have to be done so as to monitor the condition.</li>n</ul>nLung Cancer<br><br>\u27a6Definition: The inhaled fibers of asbestos tend to accumulate in the ends of the small airways in the lungs. A prolonged exposure may eventually lead to the formation of cancerous cells in the lungs. The symptoms include cough (with or without blood), wheezing, weight loss, breathing difficulties, and chest pain. Asbestos-related lung cancer usually takes about 15 years to occur after initial exposure.</p> <p>\u27a6Treatment: The treatment of lung cancer will depend upon how much the cancer has spread. In most cases, the cancer has already passed the initial stage when detected. The treatment options would most likely include medications, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Surgical treatment may also be included to remove cancerous tissues and tumor from the lungs.<br>n<ul>n<li>Chemotherapy makes use of one or more anti-cancer medication, and a variety of drugs and chemicals that are meant to kill cancer cells.</li>n<li>Radiation therapy involves using a localized high-dose of radiation on malignant tumors, thereby destroying the cancer cells in the targeted area.</li>n<li>Targeted therapy involves drugs or other substances to block the growing and spreading tendencies of cancerous cells by targeting the specific molecules responsible for the progression of this disease.</li>n<li>The surgical procedures would vary depending upon the stage of the cancer, and its histological type, i.e, whether it is small cell or non-small cell lung cancer. Depending upon these factors, surgical treatment may include: Resection (removal of the cancerous tumor along with a portion of the surrounding tissue), Lobectomy (removal of an entire cancerous section of the lung), or Pneumonectomy (removal of the entire lung).</li>n</ul>n<br><br><strong>Mesothelioma</strong><br><br>\u27a6Definition: Mesothelioma is a rare type of cancer that affects the pleura (lining of the chest cavity, outside the lung) or the peritoneum (lining of the abdomen). It is the only type of cancer that is primarily caused due to asbestos exposure. The symptoms of this cancer can be easily misinterpreted for any other common non-cancerous ailment. When the pleura is affected, one may experience cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, hoarseness, difficulty in swallowing, etc. In case of peritoneal mesothelioma, the symptoms include abdominal swelling and pain, nausea, vomiting, and unexplained weight loss. According to the American Cancer Society, \"The time between first exposure to asbestos and diagnosis of mesothelioma is usually 30 years or more.\"</p> <p><span>\u27a6</span><b>Treatment</b>: Treatments for mesothelioma include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery\u2015more or less the same as suggested for treating any other cancer. However, because mesothelioma is relatively rare, the <span>American Cancer Society</span> suggests to always take second opinion from a doctor who has a lot of experience in treating this type of cancer.n<ul>n<li>Chemotherapy involves the use of one or more anti-cancer medication, and a variety of drugs and chemicals that are efficacious in killing the cancerous cells.</li>n<li>Radiation therapy uses a localized high-dose of radiation on malignant tumors, destroying the targeted cancer cells.</li>n<li>Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to block the growth of cancerous cells by targeting the specific molecules responsible for the spreading and progression of cancer in nearby tissues.</li>n<li>The surgical procedures would vary depending upon the location of the cancer and the overall health of the person. For pleural mesothelioma, the surgical options may include <span>Extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP)</span>. As the <span>American Cancer Society</span> explains, EPP \"operation removes the lung on the side of the cancer along with the pleura lining the chest wall on that side, the diaphragm on that side, the pericardium (the sac around the heart), and nearby lymph nodes. The diaphragm and the pericardium are then reconstructed with man-made materials.\" <span>Pleurectomy/decortication (P/D)</span> is a procedure where, \"all of the pleura lining the chest wall (on the side with the cancer) is removed along with the pleura coating the lung on that same side. The pleura coating the mediastinum and the diaphragm is also removed. The lung and diaphragm are not removed.\", as explained by the <span>American Cancer Society</span>. <span>Debulking</span> is opted where the aim is to remove the maximum amount of mesothelioma as possible, however, lesser tissue is removed in this procedure as compared to P/D.</li>n<li>Surgical treatment for peritoneal mesothelioma may include: <span>Omentectomy</span> (removal of the omentum layer of fatty tissue that covers the abdominal contents) and <span>Debulking</span> (removal of the maximum possible amount of mesothelioma, which may involve removing certain portion of the intestine as well).</li>n</ul>n<div><strong>Nonmalignant Lung and Pleural Disorders</strong></div>n<br><span>\u27a6</span><b>Definition</b>: Other than the malignant and chronic diseases discussed above, asbestos exposure may lead to certain nonmalignant disorders affecting the lung and pleura as well. These include: formation of plaques in the pleura, thickening of the pleural lining, and fluid buildup between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and the wall of the chest cavity. The symptoms may not always be evident, but may include shortness of breath, wheezing, and pain. The <span>National Cancer Institute</span> states that, \"Although pleural plaques are not precursors to lung cancer, evidence suggests that people with pleural disease caused by exposure to asbestos may be at increased risk for lung cancer.\"</p> <p><span>\u27a6</span><b>Treatment</b>: The treatment is aimed at correcting the abnormality caused by asbestos exposure. Therefore, it would vary. The treatment measures basically include a combination of medication, surgery, and non-surgical procedures to relief the bothersome symptoms. Pleural effusion\u2015where fluid accumulates between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity\u2015needs treatment measures to remove the unwanted fluid. In case of pleural thickening, the treatment would depend upon the severity of the condition and related complications.n<ul>n<li>Through a procedure called <span>thoracentesis</span>, the doctor removes the fluid by inserting a needle and a catheter into the pleural space. For recurring fluid buildup, a long-term catheter is inserted through the skin into the pleural space, so that the patient can remove the fluid on his/her own at home. Another procedure to serve this purpose, and prevent recurring pleural effusions is <span>pleurodesis</span>. Here, an irritant such as talc or doxycycline is injected into the pleural space. This is done so that the substance inflames the pleura and chest wall, thereby enabling them to bind tightly to each other as they heal.</li>n<li>In case of pleural thickening, the treatment options are limited and are basically aimed at treating the symptoms that come along. Medications are prescribed to ensure easy breathing. In case of severe complications, surgery (rarely) may be considered.</li>n<li>Usually, pleural plaque needs no treatment as such because it is harmless in nature, and mostly does not cause any hindrance in the lung function. However, the treatment plan would vary depending upon the associated symptoms and possible complications.</li>n</ul>nAs mentioned earlier, the damage caused by asbestos exposure is irreversible. Although the symptoms take decades to appear, those that have been exposed to this substance must ensure to be regular with their routine checkups and tests, so as to identify the abnormalities well in advance, before it gets too late. Early diagnosis and treatment can help improve the quality of life when it comes to living with an asbestos-related illness.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Leukemia is a type of cancer associated with the blood or bone marrow because of an abnormal multiplication of blood cells, usually white blood corpuscles (leukocytes). Let us identify the underlying causes of leukemia to adopt certain preventive measures.</p> <p>Leukemia is a cancer of the bone marrow and the lymphatic system. There are different types of leukemia that can affect the health of a patient. Of these types, certain leukemia generally affect children and about 30% affect adults. Leukemia usually involves white blood cells that causes them to divide abnormally. These cells do not function properly and do not die like the normal blood cells. This causes them to crowd in the system and affect the number of normal cells. This HealthHearty article will help you learn more about the leading causes of leukemia.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>Leukemia causes extensive damage to the bone marrow, by displacing the normal bone marrow cells with a huge number of immature white blood cells resulting in a lack of blood platelets that are important in the process of blood clotting. This means people with leukemia will be easily bruised and bleed excessively, or develop pinprick bleeds (petechiae).</p> <p>White blood cells, which are involved in fighting pathogens, may be suppressed putting the patient at the risk of developing infections. The red blood cell deficiency leads to anemia, which may further cause dyspnea. However, the exact cause of leukemia is not yet understood. There are a number of factors that scientists feel are responsible for its occurrence.</p> <p>These factors cause mutation in the DNA of blood cells. This causes them to grow and divide rapidly. Their life span is also more than the normal blood cells. Thus, they crowd the healthy blood cells and lead to appearance of signs and symptoms of leukemia.</p> <h3>Factors that Lead to Leukemia</h3> <p>Numerous risk factors may be responsible for DNA damage within the blood cells. The risk factors believed to have the strongest associations with leukemia include the following major causes:</p> <p><ul>n<li><strong>Age</strong> - Roughly 60-70% of leukemia occur in people who are older than 50.</li>n<li><strong>Radiation</strong> - A high risk of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is caused among people who have been exposed to high doses of radiation.</li>n<li><strong>Chemicals</strong> - Workers who are exposed to benzene are prone to having acute leukemia. If exposed to some other solvents, herbicides, and pesticides can also cause this deadly disease.</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li><strong>Viruses</strong> - The human T-cell leukemia virus I (HTLV-I) is related to acute T-cell leukemia. It can also affect humans through animal viruses.</li>n<li><strong>Genetics</strong> - Risk of Leukemia is seen among children with Down's syndrome, which is a genetically linked chromosomal abnormality which means an extra chromosome 21. Three rare inherited disorders like Fanconi's anemia, Bloom's syndrome, and ataxia telangiectasia, also can cause leukemia.</li>n</ul></p> <p>Leukemia is also found among racial and ethnic groups with different genetic make-ups. Other factors that are suspected to be possible causes of leukemia are as follows:</p> <p><strong>a. Cigarette smoking</strong><br />Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for leukemia. Chemicals in tobacco smoke include benzene, polonium-210, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) are absorbed by the lungs and are spread via the bloodstream. It is estimated that one in four cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the result of cigarette smoking.</p> <p><strong>b. Cancer therapy</strong><br />Individuals who have undergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy for previous cancers have a greater chance of getting secondary leukemia. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has been reported after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for various solid tumors (breast cancer, ovarian cancer), blood malignancies, and nonmalignant conditions. The chemotherapeutic agents most often associated with secondary leukemias are procarbazine, chlorambucil, etoposide, mechlorethamine, teniposide, and cyclophosphamide.</p> <p>The risk is increased when these drugs are combined with radiation therapy. Most secondary leukemia cancers are developed within 9 years after treatment of Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or childhood CLL. Further chemotherapy often is ineffective in patients with secondary AML; their prognosis is less favorable than that of typical AML patients.</p> <p><strong>c. Other medical therapy and events</strong><br />Use of the antibiotic chloramphenicol has been linked with the development of childhood leukemia. Other medications, such as growth hormones and phenylbutazone, also have reportedly shown some associations with leukemia. Leukemia and lymphomas have been observed in recipients of organ transplants, and certain immunodeficiency syndromes are associated with leukemia (e.g., infantile X-linked agammaglobulinemia and lymphatic leukemia).</p> <p>Researchers have studied the many cellular changes associated with leukemia; however it is unknown why these changes occur. Many risk factors are involved and most of them are unmodifiable (beyond control). Other factors (e.g., environmental, lifestyle-related variables) are controllable (modifiable).</p> <p><strong>d. Miscellaneous</strong><br />All cancers, including leukemia, begin as a mutation in the genetic material- the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), within certain cells. The abnormal leukemia cells remain in an immature blast form that never matures properly. They do not die off like normal cells, but tend to multiply and accumulate within the body like I included in the first paragraph of this article.</p> <p><strong>e. DNA errors</strong><br />DNA errors may occur in the form of translocations. Damage produced when part of one chromosome becomes displaced and attached to another chromosome. Translocations disrupt the normal sequencing of the genes. As a result, oncogenes (cancer-promoting genes) on the chromosomes may be \"switched on,\" while tumor suppressors (cancer-preventing genes) may be switched off. Much leukemia contains translocations that affect the blood cell chromosomes. Physicians often test for these translocations to help diagnose leukemia, determine a patient's prognosis, and identify the error.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Joint pain</li>n<li>Weakness and fatigue</li>n<li>Easy Bruising</li>n<li>Swollen or bleeding gums</li>n<li>Swollen tonsils</li>n<li>Enlarged liver and spleen</li>n<li>Loss of appetite and/or weight</li>n<li>Frequent infection</li>n<li>Bone pain</li>n<li>Fever, chills, night sweats and other flu-like symptoms</li>n<li>Neurological symptoms (headache)</li>n</ul></p> <p>Until we find the cause or causes of leukemia, there is no way to prevent the disease. Even when we figure the cause, they may prove to be things which are not readily controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation, and therefore not especially be helpful for prevention purposes. It is thus, not always possible to use preventive measures in case of leukemia.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Leukemia is a cancer of the blood which begins in the bone marrow leading to an abnormal proliferation of blood cells, usually white blood cells (leukocytes). There are different types of leukemia mainly based on its kind of progression. Let us have a look at them.</p> <p>There are different types of cancers that affects patients around the world. One such cancer is leukemia. This cancer occurs in the bone marrow that helps in formation of blood. Thus, a person with leukemia suffers from production of abnormal white blood cells. These abnormal cells are called leukemia cells. These cells do not proliferate like normal blood cells and they tend to crowd the bloodstream. Thus, the number of normal blood cells decreases leading to many health complications. There are different types of leukemia, that will be discussed in the following HealthHearty paragraphs.</p> <h3>Types of Leukemia</h3> <p><strong>Based on Proliferation</strong><br>The first division of leukemia is according to its acute and chronic form.</p> <h3>Acute Leukemia</h3> <p>This type of leukemia is characterized by the rapid growth of immature blood cells. This crowding makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells. Acute forms of leukemia can occur in children and young adults. (In fact, it is a more common cause of death for children in the US than any other type of malignant disease). Immediate treatment is required due to the rapid progression and accumulation of the malignant cells, which then spill over into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body. If left untreated, the patient will die within months or even weeks.</p> <h3>Chronic leukemia</h3> <p>Chronic leukemia is distinguished by the excessive build up of relatively mature, but still abnormal, blood cells. Typically taking months to years to progress, the cells are produced at a higher rate than normal cells, resulting in many abnormal white blood cells in the blood. Chronic leukemia mostly occurs in older people, but can theoretically occur in any age group.</p> <p>Acute leukemia must be treated immediately, chronic forms are sometimes monitored for some time before treatment to make sure maximum effectiveness of therapy.</p> <p><strong>Based on Kind of Blood Cell Affected</strong><br>The disease is classified according to the type of abnormal cells found in the blood.</p> <h3>Lymphocytic leukemia</h3> <p>Also called, lymphoblastic leukemia, it occurs when the B cell lymphocytes turn become abnormal and lead to leukemia.</p> <h3>Myelogenous Leukemia</h3> <p>Myeloid leukemia or myelogenous leukemia is a type of cancer that occurs in red blood cells and sometimes affects the white blood cells as well as platelets.</p> <p><strong>Based on the Above Two Groups</strong><br>The above two groups forms the bases of the four main kinds of leukemia's. These types of leukemia may further have more subcategories, but the main types are as follows:</p> <h3>Acute lymphocytic leukemia</h3> <p>Also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia or (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially at age 65 and older. This type is a cancer of the white blood cells, characterized by the overproduction and continuous multiplication of malignant and immature white blood in the bone marrow. It is a hematological malignancy.</p> <h3>Acute myelogenous leukemia</h3> <p>Also known as acute myeloid leukemia or (AML) occurs more commonly in adults than in children. This was previously called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.</p> <p><i>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia</i> (CLL)<br>CLL most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, children are never affected by CLL.</p> <p><i>Chronic myelogenous leukemia</i> (CML)<br>CML occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. This type is characterized by increased and unregulated clonal production of predominantly myeloid cells in the bone marrow.</p> <p><i>Hairy cell leukemia</i> (HCL)<br>This leukemia is generally a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It mostly affects adult men and is incurable. However, there are treatments that help control the proliferation of this cancer.</p> <p><em>Large granular lymphocytic leukemia</em><br>The T-cells or NK cells are involved and is a very rare type of leukemia. This rare cancer is not very aggressive, therefore treatment is successful in most cases.</p> <p><i>T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia</i> (T-PLL)<br>This is a very rare form of leukemia that is really aggressive in nature. It affects adults and involves mature T cells. This is very difficult to treat and survival rate is poor.</p> <p><em>Adult T-cell leukemia</em><br>The human T-lymphotropic virus (HTVL) (type of virus), can affect the CD4+ T-cells. This causes them to replicate and proliferate abnormally leading to adult T-cell leukemia.</p> <h3>Causes of Leukemia</h3> <p>Leukemia is like other cancers, resulting from somatic mutations in the DNA which activate oncogenes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes, and disrupts the regulation of cell death, differentiation or division. These mutations may occur spontaneously or as a result of exposure to radiation or carcinogenic substances and are likely to be influenced by genetic factors. Cohort and case-control studies have linked exposure to petrochemicals, such as benzene, and hair dyes to the development of some forms of leukemia.</p> <p>Regular and unprotected exposure to some chemicals can lead to the development of leukemia. However, exposure to chemicals while on the job is the cause of the leukemia. Persons with Down syndrome are also at a greater risk of developing leukemia than the general public. Anyone who has received chemotherapy treatments as treatment for another form of cancer is also much more likely to develop leukemia than a person who has never received chemotherapy treatments. Persons who suffer with the blood disease known as <I>Myelodysplastic syndrome</I> may also find themselves with a diagnosis of leukemia as a natural progression of their condition.</p> <p>The leukemia specialist will determine the specific type that has developed. It is easier to evaluate overall health conditions which come up with a treatment program that will be right for the patient. Radiation therapy may be determined to be the best treatment. For the next person, biological therapy may be seen as the right treatment.</p> <p>The main cause of leukemia is the exposure to very high levels of radiation. However, radiation exposure at a nuclear reactor or being exposed to the massive amount of radiation released when an atomic bomb explodes definitely is linked to leukemia.</p> <p>Viruses have also been linked to some forms of leukemia. Fanconi anemia is also a risk factor for developing leukemia. Until the cause or causes of leukemia are found, there is no way to prevent the disease. Even when the causes become known, they may prove to be things which are not readily controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation, and therefore not especially helpful for prevention purposes.</p> <p>This was all about the types of leukemia and some of the possible causes of this grave disease. These can be controlled, of caught during their early stages. For more information, speak to a specialist for detailed explanation.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Malaria is a parasitic disease that causes flu-like symptoms, and without treatment it leads to complication, that may cause death. It is better to take the preventive measures by identifying its causes.</p> <p>Many people often ask what is Malaria disease? Malaria is a parasitic disease. This means that it is caused by a parasite, a tiny organism that lives in or on other organisms called a host. This parasite is from the genus <i>Plasmodium</i> and the host is a female mosquito of the <i>Anopheles</i> genus. The parasite is transferred to a potential victim when he or she is bitten by a mosquito.</p> <p>Though treatable and preventable, annually this disease kills 350-500 thousand around the world most victims are children who live near the Sahara area in Africa. In the United States only 1,300 cases are seen each year. This HealthHearty article on malaria symptoms, causes and treatment will cover information that will help you learn more about this dangerous disease.</p> <h3>Causes of Malaria</h3> <p>Malaria is caused by a parasite that has infected the saliva glands of a female mosquito. There are five types of <i>Plasmodium</i> that can infect humans. They include <i>P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax and P. knowlesi</i>. Most number of cases of malaria are caused by <i>P. falciparum</i>. Once a mosquito that has been infected by the parasite that has grown to a certain stage of development bites someone then that person gets malaria. If another female mosquito then bites the malaria victim, she can pass it to other people without being infected itself (that mosquito is called a vector).</p> <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3> <p>The symptoms of Malaria can vary greatly, from no symptoms at all or mild to extremely serious and may even result in death. Malaria is often divided into two different categories. The first category is called the <i>uncomplicated</i> category and the other is <i>complicated</i> category.</p> <h3>Incubation Period of Malaria</h3> <p>Depending on the type of parasite the incubation period can range anywhere from 7-30 days. People who have traveled to Malaria prone areas should tell their doctor that they have done so, because even with the antimalarial drugs, some types of malaria can delay onset of symptoms for up to one year.</p> <h3>1. Uncomplicated Malaria</h3> <p>The general (but very infrequent) attack of malaria usually continues 6-10 hours. There are three phases to this and these usually return every 2 to 3 days depending upon the type of parasite.n<ul>n<li>The cold phase (shivering, feeling cold)</li>n<li>The hot phase (vomiting, fever, headache; convulsions in children)</li>n<li>The Sweating phase (sweating, normal temperature, sleepiness)</li>n</ul></p> <p>However, more often the patient usually has the following signs and symptoms:n<ul>n<li>Chills</li>n<li>Fever</li>n<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>n<li>Headache</li>n<li>General discomfort</li>n<li>Body aches</li>n</ul></p> <p>In some patients, one may observe enlarged spleen, fever, perspiration, general weakness. If a patient is infected with <i>P. Falciparum</i>, they may develop symptoms such as enlarged Liver, mild jaundice, and increase respiratory rate.</p> <p>Depending upon the country and the frequency that malaria is experienced the patient will either self-medicate; as we do here in America with a cold or they will seek professional help after improper medications fail to take effect.</p> <h3>2. Complicated Malaria</h3> <p>This usually occurs where there is either low or no immunity to this disease, including locations where Malaria disease is rare or immunity is low because of other health risks. Complicated malaria results in blood and organ disorders, including fluid on the lung, and loss of kidney function.</p> <p>In all areas of the world complicated Malaria disease is an emergency and should be treated as quickly and as intensely as possible because without treatment other major medical problems appear and eventually death does occur. As with other conditions pregnancy may be complicated resulting in pre-term labor or low birth-weight babies. In some extreme cases, there is a possibility of early termination of the pregnancy.</p> <h3>Severe Malarial Bouts</h3> <p>When a patients develops a serious <i>P. falciparum</i> infection, it results in multiple organ failure. It may even lead to abnormalities in the normal metabolism of the patient and blood. These complications include:n<ul>n<li>Severe anemia due to destruction of normal red blood cells</li>n<li>Presence of hemoglobin urine (hemoglobinuria)</li>n<li>Pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</li>n<li>Decrease in blood platelets that leads to blood coagulation and thrombocytopenia</li>n<li>Cardiovascular shock</li>n<li>Low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia), especially in pregnant women</li>n</ul></p> <p><strong>Malarial Relapse</strong><br />Malaria relapses are also known to happen, even months and years after the first attack. This is due to one genus of parasites having dormant stages that have been known to reactivate long after the disease has been cured. There are medications that are able to prevent this and should be started as soon after the first attack as possible.</p> <h3>Treatment of Malaria Disease</h3> <p>Laboratory tests should be performed and diagnosis of Malaria Disease should be confirmed before any treatment is started. Not doing this should be reserved only for special cases, limiting it to those situations where clear suspicion of a very extreme case is determined and lack of facilities necessitates doing so.</p> <p>Treatment is determined by three specifications:n<ul>n<li>The species of infecting parasite - This is for three different reasons.n<ul>n<li><i>P. falciparum</i> causes a severe and quickly progressing illness or death, while the other three species rarely are this severe.</li>n<li><i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. ovale</i> demand treatment for forms that remain dormant and can induce repeat infections.</li>n<li><i>P. falciparum</i> and <i>P. vivax</i> are known for different resistance levels in different geographic areas where infections occur. For <i>P. Falciparum</i> rapid beginning of treatment is extremely necessary.</li>n</ul>n</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li>The physical state of the infected person.</li>n<li>The resistance level of the parasites determined by the place the person was when infected.</li>n<li>In addition other things to remember about the drug treatment.</li>n<li>Other ailments the patient has:n<ul>n<li>Pregnancy</li>n<li>Drug allergies and sensitivities.</li>n</ul>n</li>n</ul></p> <p><strong>Drugs</strong><br />Some antimalarial medications can be given intravenously. The usual medications for malaria are:n<ul>n<li>Chloroquine</li>n<li>Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</li>n<li>Mefloquine</li>n<li>Atovaquone-proguanil</li>n<li>Quinine</li>n<li>Doxycycline</li>n<li>Artemisinin derivatives (these are usually only available outside the United States)</li>n</ul></p> <p>Malaria kills thousands of people unnecessarily. With immediate and correct treatment people are able to recover from this disease with no problem. It also must be realized that delay appearance of in symptoms is possible. Any suspected cases of malaria must be reported to health care providers. Also, in the United States it is imperative to report any cases of malaria to the CDC. You should follow all the measures to prevent malaria. This was all about malaria disease causes, symptoms and treatment. For more information, especially when traveling to malaria-prone regions, speak to a healthcare provider for more details.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Mercury poisoning is caused due to over exposure to mercury in some form. It may result into many unrelated diseases. Let us have a look at symptoms of mercury poisoning.</p> <p>Mercury is a natural and very poisonous substance which is odorless, colorless and tasteless. Its chemical symbol is Hg. The most commonly found and used compound of mercury is mercuric sulfide (HgS). It is a refined form of cinnabar, and has numerous applications. It is used in paint, batteries and many other industrial and household items. The most well-known use of HgS is in thermometer. It also constitutes for about 50% of the total contents of amalgam dental fillings.</p> <p>Owing to the large applications of mercury, the chances of exposure to it are also very high. Overexposure to mercury results in a condition named mercury poisoning. The symptoms of this condition are systemic. This means that it does not just affect one part of the body, but it affects every system in the body. In addition to this, mercury poisoning inhibits the function of immune system and therefore the patient will have other diseases as well.</p> <h2>Symptoms of Mercury Poisoning</h2> <p>Mercury can affect almost all the parts of your body. It is one of the most toxic and dangerous metal which can cause many diseases. Numerous variable symptoms may delay the treatment, because in the absence of peculiar symptoms, both doctor and patient attempt to cure other possible diseases. Hence, it is a must that you identify certain symptoms that are associated with mercury poisoning especially when you suspect any type of mercury exposure. Following are some of the symptoms which may be observed in case of mercury poisoning.</p> <p><div><strong>In Adults</strong></div>n<br><strong>Psychological Disturbances</strong><br>n<ul>n<li>Fits of anger</li>n<li>Short term memory loss</li>n<li>Low self-esteem</li>n<li>Insomnia</li>n<li>Loss of self-control</li>n<li>Loss of ability to learn new things</li>n</ul>n<strong>Oral Cavity Problems</strong>n<ul>n<li>Inflammation of the mouth</li>n<li>Loss of bone around teeth</li>n<li>Ulcerated gums</li>n<li>Ulcers on other areas in the mouth</li>n<li>Darkening of gums</li>n<li>Metallic taste in mouth</li>n<li>Bleeding gums</li>n</ul>n<strong>Digestive Tract Problems</strong>n<ul>n<li>Cramps</li>n<li>Inflamed colon</li>n<li>Diarrhea</li>n</ul>n<strong>Cardiovascular Problems</strong>n<ul>n<li>Weak pulse</li>n<li>Blood pressure problems</li>n<li>Chest pain</li>n<li>Feeling of pressure in the chest</li>n</ul>n<strong>Respiratory problems</strong>n<ul>n<li>Weakness</li>n<li>Problems with breathing</li>n<li>Emphysema</li>n<li>Persistent cough</li>n</ul>n<strong>Neurological Problems</strong>n<ul>n<li>Headaches</li>n<li>Vertigo</li>n<li>Tinnitus</li>n<li>Twitching eyelids, feet, hands etc.</li>n</ul>n<div><strong>In Children</strong></div>n<br><strong>Developmental Problems</strong>n<ul>n<li>Autism</li>n<li>Asperger's syndrome</li>n<li>PDD-NOS</li>n<li>ADD</li>n</ul>n<strong>Neurological Problems</strong>n<ul>n<li>Decreased eye contact</li>n<li>Repeating certain actions over and over again</li>n<li>Not responding to their name</li>n<li>Not looking at an object when pointed</li>n<li>Poor concentration or attention</li>n<li>Sensitivity to sensory stimulation</li>n</ul>n<strong>Speech Related Problems</strong>n<ul>n<li>Loss or delay of speech</li>n<li>Difficulty in understanding and articulating words</li>n<li>Difficulty in memorizing</li>n</ul>n<strong>Social Behavioral Problems</strong>n<ul>n<li>Irritability</li>n<li>Aggressive behavior</li>n<li>Night terrors</li>n<li>Insomnia</li>n<li>Mood swings</li>n</ul>n<strong>Auto-immune prolems</strong>n<ul>n<li>Multiple sclerosis</li>n<li>Juvenile diabetes</li>n<li>Asthma</li>n<li>Chronic ear infections</li>n<li>Decreased immunity</li>n</ul>nOne must note that mercury poisoning cannot be the only cause of every disorder mentioned above. However, it can certainly lead to some of the above conditions. If you suspect that you were exposed to any form of mercury, then contact a doctor immediately. Early medical intervention will help to control the toxic effect of mercury poisoning. You can contact your local poison control center and ask for their assistance.</p> <h2>Causes of Mercury Poisoning</h2> <p>Mercury poisoning is the result of too much exposure to mercury. It can be caused by any method which includes mercury for treatment. Amalgam dental fillings is one of the main causes of this condition. Mercury poisoning from fillings may take some time before possible symptoms appear. Other causes are eating fish that have been exposed to mercury in the environment. Industrial and workplace exposure such as in a paint industry or hospital poses a potential threat of mercury poisoning. Even breakage of thermometer at home can cause serious mercury poisoning. The mercury vapors that linger in air can be particularly hazardous.</p> <p>Exposure to mercury may even occur through cosmetics. There have been several cases of mercury poisoning in the South-West states by a company that sold a beauty cream with <em>calomel&nbsp; </em>listed as an ingredient. <em>Calomel&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>is mercurous chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>). This product had mercury levels around 10%. In Germany, there were cases of mercury poisoning through the use of over the counter hair bleaching products that had no warning label concerning the contents. The results were loss of hair and discolored fingernails.</p> <p>Considering the severity of mercury poisoning, it is a must that you prevent any hazards of mercury exposure. Warn your family about the potential dangers of mercury in household items. Most importantly, guard your kids against accidental mercury exposure. Keep them away from the reach of mercury containing items like thermometers, medical devices, some disinfectants, fluorescent light bulbs, etc. Read the labels before buying any product and look for any mercury warning sign.</p> <p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</em></p>"

    "post_name": "crystal-methamphetamine-addiction-crystal-meth-effects",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>A form of methamphetamine that can be smoked, crystal meth has horrible effects on the central nervous system of the body.</p> <p>Crystal methamphetamine is a drug that is a pure form of methamphetamine which could be smoked. It is a stimulant that is extremely addictive, and which if used on a regular basis can lead to severe physiological and psychological dependence. This class of drugs is also known as speed, ice, or crank.</p> <p>Methamphetamine was synthesized by a Japanese chemist in the year 1919 and it was used during the Second World War to keep the troops awake and to ensure that the workers in factories retained their energy. Addiction to crystal meth is one of the biggest problems in the United States today. There are as many as 1.5 million people addicted to crystal meth in the country alone.</p> <p>These drugs are similar to cocaine in their effect but are stronger and their effect lasts longer. The reason meth is this highly addictive is because it works by activating the pleasure centers of the brain that creates a sensation of well-being. When a user makes use of meth, their heart rate, blood pressure, and rate of respiration increases which cause extreme elation. This 'high' that is experienced tends to be highest when a person uses the drug for the first time. Because users tend to believe that the 'high' will remain as intense every time, they continue using it, but they do not understand that the intensity cannot be repeated every time.</p> <h2>How Does Methamphetamine Affect You?</h2> <p>Crystal methamphetamine has such an intense effect that not only does it affect a user physically but also psychologically. The many effects that regular use of crystal meth can have on your system are listed in this section. One of the most intense changes that occur in a person as a result of using meth is the absolute change in their appearance. Heavy use of meth usually results in the blood vessels getting constricted.</p> <p>This in turn causes the flow of blood to different parts of the body to get affected. The result is that the tissues of the body become damaged and the ability of the body to repair itself is affected. Continuous usage also makes the skin prone to acne, body sores, and causes loss of luster and elasticity. Often users also hallucinate that they have bugs crawling under their skin (a condition known as formication), which results in skin picking that also causes sores. This is one of the most evident change caused due to prolonged meth use.</p> <h3>Physiological Effects of Crystal Meth Use</h3> <p>Prolonged use of crystal meth may cause many severe physical effects. The change in appearance is just one of the more obvious changes that one can see. Given below is a list of the probable physical effects of meth use.n<ul>n<li>Hyperactivity</li>n<li>Dilation of pupils</li>n<li>Headache</li>n<li>Dry mouth</li>n<li>Lack of coordination in movement</li>n<li>Insomnia</li>n<li>Sting traces on arms and legs</li>n<li>Tachycardia</li>n<li>Hypertension</li>n<li>Arrhythmia</li>n<li>Blurred vision</li>n<li>Diaphoresis</li>n<li>Convulsions</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Psychological Effects of Crystal Meth Use</h3> <p>People often ask the question, how does methamphetamine affect behavior, and the answer to this can be varied. As with the physical changes and conditions that can develop, there are many behavioral changes that a meth user may display.n<ul>n<li>Anxiety</li>n<li>Euphoria</li>n<li>Increased alertness</li>n<li>Irritability</li>n<li>Mood swings</li>n<li>Aggressiveness</li>n<li>Delusions of grandeur</li>n<li>Hallucinatory behavior</li>n<li>Misplaced feeling of powerfulness and invincibility</li>n<li>Obsessive behavior</li>n<li>Paranoia</li>n</ul></p> <p>Often when the use of crystal meth is stopped, the user tends to display extreme withdrawal symptoms. These could include fatigue, depression, increase in appetite, anxiety, irritability, hypersomnia, vivid dreams, deep sleep, and in some cases, even suicidal tendencies. Withdrawal periods may differ but usually last for weeks and even months in case of heavy users. The severity is largely dependent on the time period of the addiction and the amount of crystal meth taken.</p> <p>Crystal methamphetamine addiction, over a period of time, can be potentially life-threatening because it slowly yet steadily affects the body and the mind. It is therefore important that necessary steps be taken in order to help an addict reduce and ultimately stop his addiction to crystal meth.</p>"

As a result, the balance of fluids and electrolytes in the body gets disturbed, thereby creating serious health problems.<br><br>Renal failure may arise due to trauma, autoimmune disorders, infection, urinary tract blockage, and other kidney diseases. Kidney failure is categorized as acute or chronic, depending on its rate of progression. A <strong><span>sudden</span> </strong>loss of kidney function is termed as <strong><span>acute renal failure</span></strong>, whereas a <strong><span>gradual</span> </strong>loss of kidney function is called <strong><span>chronic renal failure</span></strong>.

In individuals with chronic kidney failure, vomiting generally occurs in the morning, whereas those with acute renal failure experience frequent episodes of vomiting within a period of 2-3 days. It is often accompanied with diarrhea.<br><br><strong><span>Dehydration:</span></strong> The excessive loss of fluids through vomiting and diarrhea, leads to dehydration and excessive thirst.<br><br><strong><span>Breathing difficulty:</span> </strong>The inability to get rid of excess fluids may lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, thereby causing shortness of breath. Also, the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood reduces due to increased blood toxicity, leading to heavy breathing.<br><br><strong><span>Bloody stools:</span></strong> In extreme cases, kidney failure may lead to gastric or intestinal bleeding. This is indicated by the presence of blood in stools.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>While a bladder infection is the most common type of urinary tract infection, the infection could even spread to the kidneys. In this article, we would be looking into kidney infection symptoms and treatment options.</p> <p>Women are more likely to suffer from urinary tract infections due to the shorter size of urethra and the proximity of the urethral opening to the vagina and the anus. If a bladder infection is not treated at an early stage, bacteria can move further up into the kidneys through the ureters, thereby causing a kidney infection. Such an infection is medically referred to as&nbsp;<strong>pyelonephritis</strong>.</p> <p><b>How Do You Know If You Have Kidney Infection</b></p> <p>People suffering from a kidney infection are most likely to experience certain symptoms.<ul><li>Pain and burning sensation during urination</li><li>Strong urge to urinate</li><li>Frequent urination</li><li>Smelly urine</li><li>Chills</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Vomiting</li><li>Stinging pain in the lower back</li><li>Sudden unexplained fever</li><li>Sudden unexplained fatigue</li><li>Blood or pus in urine</li><li>Malaise</li></ul>If there is a burning sensation accompanied by pain during urination, it may be a sign of a kidney infection. This symptom should not be confused with the burning and itching sensation that is felt by those suffering from a yeast infection.</p> <p>A constant or recurring dull to throbbing pain in the lower back (around the waist) or the flank region another common symptom of kidney infection. These symptoms may also be accompanied by a mild fever. If you feel lethargic for no apparent reason, even though you have been well rested, it is time to visit your physician immediately.</p> <p><b>How is Kidney Infection Treatment</b></p> <p>A timely diagnosis and treatment can prevent life-threatening complications from arising. If a person is diagnosed with pyelonephritis, doctors may prescribe a sulfa drug for clearing off the infection. If you know that you are allergic to sulfa drugs, or get to know after beginning the course of medication, let your doctor know immediately. Since bacteria are the causal agents, kidney infection treatment would involve the use of antibiotics. A broad-spectrum antibiotic would be prescribed initially until doctors are able to identify the causal bacteria through urine culture and blood culture. This would help them in determining what are the most effective antibiotics for kidney infection in each case. Quinolones, Beta-lactam antibiotics, Trimethoprim and Co-Trimoxazole are some of the antibiotics that are commonly prescribed for treating a kidney infection.</p> <p>In severe cases where the patient is unable to take drugs orally, hospitalization would be required. The patient would have to be administered antibiotics and fluids intravenously. If a structural abnormality in the kidneys or urinary tract is causing recurring infections, it would have to be surgically repaired. It is also essential to take precautionary measures to prevent kidney infections in future. Doctors usually tell the patients to drink plenty of water. This not only helps in flushing out the toxins, but will also gradually help in flushing out the infection-causing bacteria. Many believe that drinking pure cranberry juice can help in preventing urinary tract infections or a kidney infection. Here are some self-care measures that could help in preventing a kidney infection.<br><ul><li>Always clean the genital area before and after sexual intercourse.</li><li>Urinate before and after indulging in sexual intercourse.</li><li>Urinate as soon as you feel the urge to. Do not hold back the urge to urinate for long periods of time.</li><li>Wear cotton undergarments which allow for air circulation. This will help in discouraging the growth of bacteria.</li><li>Women must always wipe from front to back after urinating or defecating.</li></ul>A kidney infection should never be taken lightly. If left untreated, the condition of the kidneys could deteriorate quickly, leading to other bodily complications. Visit your physician on experiencing any of the aforementioned symptoms and go through the entire course of medication that is prescribed. Even a trace of the infection that may be left behind could trigger another major infection.</p> <p><b><i>Disclaimer</i></b>: <i>The information provided in this article is solely for educating the reader.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>According to a study, bladder cancer is one of the most common type of cancers. It generally affects older adults, though it can occur at any age. The upcoming HealthHearty article provides in-depth information on bladder cancer symptoms and treatment.</p> <p>Every year, around 60,000 to 80,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer, and around 10,000 people lose their lives to this disease. It is 3 to 4 times more likely to be detected in men than in women, and it is more prevalent in white men when compared to African-American men. This cancer killed an estimate of 15,210 people in 2013.</p> <h3>What is Bladder Cancer?</h3> <p>\u2714 It is an uncontrolled, unnatural growth and multiplication of carcinogen cells in the urinary bladder. These cells can no more be controlled by the normal mechanisms of the body. The lumps (nodules) developed inside the bladder can be malignant or benign.</p> <p>\u2714 Bladder is a muscular, balloon-shaped hollow organ that stores urine (a fluid that contains water and wastes not required by the body). The kidney separates the waste products from our blood and passes it to the bladder for eliminating it from the body.</p> <p>\u2714 This cancer is classified into different types based on the appearance of its cells under the microscope. The types include: transitional cell carcinoma (a common type of bladder cancer, which develops in the cells present in the lining of the bladder walls), squamous cell carcinoma, and glandular cell carcinoma, also known as, adenocarcinomas.</p> <p>\u2714 It is also classified based on the nature of the tumor and the extent of its spread. It is called superficial bladder cancer if the tumor has not gone beyond the linings of the bladder and spread to the other parts.</p> <p>\u2714 It is called invasive cancer if it starts spreading to the muscle walls of the bladder (this type has a greater probability of spreading to the other parts of the body).</p> <h3>Who is at Risk?</h3> <p>\u261b Like any other type of cancer, people in their old age (who are 60 and above) are mainly at the risk of developing bladder cancer. History indicates that majority of the patients are males (amongst those suffering from this cancer, around 70% are males).</p> <p>\u261b According to a study, obese people, cigarette smokers, and people who prefer junk or processed foods over fruits and vegetables are at the highest risk of developing this disease. Also, people suffering from hematuria are also highly prone to developing this condition.</p> <p>\u261b Even people who come in contact with minerals, such as iron, steel, and other cancer-causing environmental toxic substances are highly susceptible to acquiring this illness.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p><ul>n<li>The patient cannot hold the normal volume of urine and needs to pass it frequently.</li>n<li>He/she may experience pain in the area near the bladder, such as the pelvis region and also while urinating.</li>n<li>Experiencing burning sensation while passing urine.</li>n<li>Despite feeling the urge to urinate (assuming that the bladder is filled), the person may not be able to do so.</li>n<li>Presence of blood in the urine (hematuria), which makes it appear bright red or cola colored.</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>\u2714 Your doctor may first test your urine sample to detect possible infection and presence of blood. He/she may suggest you to undergo cystoscopy in order to determine any abnormality inside the bladder.</p> <p>\u2714 A urogram, also known as intravenous pyelogram, can also be used to diagnose this cancer. In a urogram, a special type of dye is injected into the patient, which is then excreted from the blood by the kidneys. This dye is then examined through X-ray scanning in order to detect any abnormalities. </p> <p>\u2714 Along with the above-mentioned techniques, CT scan, MRI scan, and few other techniques, such as ultrasound imaging and urine-based tests are also used for diagnosing this cancer.</p> <h3>Treatment Options</h3> <p>\u261b Like the other types of cancers, bladder cancer can also be treated using surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, medication, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, nutritional therapy, interferons/interleukins, etc.</p> <p>\u261b Surgery, also known as cystectomy, is used to remove the infected part of the bladder or the entire bladder from the patient's body. The organs removed in men during cystectomy include bladder, prostate, and lymph nodes, whereas in women it includes the bladder, uterus and also some part of the anterior vagina-wall. </p> <p>\u261b Medication can be used to destroy the remaining infected cells and help the patient regain strength after the surgery. The type and combination of various remedial options to be followed will be decided by the physician based on the stage of cancer and complexity associated.</p> <p>\u261b For patients with bladder cancer in its early stage, transurethral resection (TUR) can also be employed depending on various factors. In this technique, the tumor on the bladder wall is scrapped using a resectoscope.</p> <p>However, there are certain side effects of the various intervention options, such as the destruction of uninfected cells after radiotherapy, the patient may experience lethargy due to the strong medication, etc. Therefore, it is very important to pay proper attention to the patient's diet and take proper medication after the cancer treatment. Patients are generally advised to undergo a bladder re-construction therapy after the removal of the infected bladder.</p> <p>You can minimize the risk of acquiring bladder cancer by quitting smoking, as smokers are most prone to developing any type of cancer. Try to include vegetables and fruits in your daily diet, and avoid the intake of junk or processed foods. Also, avoid exposing yourself to toxic substances, such as chemicals, and take the necessary precautions before you handle such things. Exercise regularly and get into the habit of undergoing routine medical tests to keep any sort of health problem at bay.</p> <p><i>Disclaimer: This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

We have two kidneys, which are on both the sides of the spine.</p> <h3>Kidney Cancer</h3> <p>It is caused due to growth of carcinogenic cells in the kidneys. There are two major types of kidney cancer; renal cell cancer and renal pelvis cancer (transitional cell cancer). Renal cell cancer is further categorized into several types such as clear cell cancer (majority of cancer cases fall under this category), chromaphobe cancer, and papillary cancer, etc. There are still several types of renal cell cancers which are unclassified.</p> <h3>Who is at Risk?</h3> <p>Like any other type of cancer, people in their old age are mainly at the risk of developing kidney cancer (people of age group 60 and above). History indicates that majority of patients suffering from this cancer are males (about 60% of the total number of patients). According to a study, obese people, cigarette smokers, and people who prefer junk or processed food and take in very less amount of fruits and vegetables in their diet are at the highest risk of developing kidney cancer (However, it has not yet been confirmed if the diet has something to do with this type of cancer).</p> <p>Along with the group of people mentioned above, people who come in contact with crude minerals such as iron, steel, etc., and other cancer causing substances, people who are suffering from kidney related diseases, people suffering from high blood pressure, people suffering from cancer in other organs (that has started spreading to other parts of the body) etc., are also at the risk of developing kidney cancer.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Blood in urine is considered as one of the most prominent indications of kidney cancer, however, problems such as kidney stone and kidney infection also result in blood in urine, hence it is important to undergo confirmatory tests. Along with the blood in urine, other symptoms like pain in lower back, swelling in the kidney and its surrounding area (also in the ankles and legs), lumps in the abdominal area, fever, anemia, lethargy, weight loss and excessive sweating etc., are also recorded.</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>Generally an X-ray scan or CAT scan is used to identify if there is an abnormal growth of cells in a patient's kidney. Once an abnormal growth is confirmed, physicians use biopsy to find out if the cells taken from kidney are carcinogenic or not (i.e., cancer cells). Along with the techniques given above, there are few more techniques used to diagnose kidney cancer.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Similar to most of the other types of cancers, kidney cancer also can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, medication, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, nutritional therapy, interferon/interleukin, etc. Surgery is used to remove the infected part of the kidney or entire kidney from the patient's body (along with a part of the kidney, other infected areas are also removed during the surgery). Medication can be used to destroy the remaining infected cells and help the patient regain strength after surgery. The type and combination of various treatments to be followed will be decided by the physician based on the stage of kidney cancer and the complexity involved.</p> <p>However, there are certain side effects of various treatments such as destruction of uninfected cells after radiotherapy; patient might experience lethargy due to strong dose of medication etc. It is very important to pay attention to the patient's diet and take proper medication after the cancer treatment.</p> <p>Chances of survival of kidney cancer patients are almost 50%, whereas the risk goes on increasing as the patient's age increases. The survival chances also depend on the stage of the disease. If the tumor has not started spreading outside the kidney, a patient's chances of getting cured are high, whereas the chances become thin if the tumor has burst and cancer has started spreading. Similar to other types of cancers, kidney cancer is very difficult to cure in its advanced stage.</p> <h3>Prevention Tips</h3> <p>1) Quit smoking, as smokers are at the highest risk level of developing any type of cancer.<br>2) Try to include vegetables and fruits in your daily diet and avoid junk or processed food.<br>3) Try to avoid toxic substances such as chemicals, etc. Take necessary precautions before you handle such things.<br>4) Exercise regularly.</p> <div class=\"buzzle-masonry-2\"> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/fruits-vegetables/1280-660690606-star-fruit-carambola.jpg\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/fruits-vegetables/1280-478865877-mangosteen-fruit.jpg\"></a> </div></div>"

This article provides some information on the same.</p> <h3>Testicular Cancer</h3> <p>It is caused due to the growth of carcinogenic cells in the testicles. There is no exact cause known of how testicular cancer is caused in men.</p> <h3>Who is at risk?</h3> <p>Maximum number of people affected by this medical condition are of young age (people of age group from 15 to 40). According to a study, white men are more prone to this type of cancer than men of other races. People with a specific condition called cryptorchidism (also known as undescended testicle), those with testicular infections, and those with specific genetic condition which is known as Klinefelter's syndrome are at the highest risk level of developing this disease. Further, it also has been witnessed that it is hereditary i.e. a person whose family members are affected by this medical condition is also at a risk of developing it. (This is a list of medically proven risk factors)</p> <p>Along with the above mentioned group of people, those who come in contact with crude minerals such as iron, steel, etc., and other cancer-causing substances and toxic substances, smokers, and those affected by cancer in other organs that has started spreading to other parts of the body etc. also may be at a risk of developing this medical condition.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Development of small and hard lumps (nodules) around the testicles is one of the most prominent symptoms of this disease. Along with the development of lumps (nodules) around testicles, the other signs that the affected person may experience are pain in the testicles and in the area surrounding the same, swelling in the testicles and scrotums, and unusual enlargement of testicles. Further, the affected person experiences pain in lower abdominal area, back, and also in groin areas, collection of water in the scrotums etc.</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>This medical condition is believed to be easy to identify as compared to other types of cancers. Most of the time, men themselves find the problem by examining their testicles. The technique of examining testicles is also known as testicular self-examination (TSE, which is also recommended by doctors), in which testicles (one at a time) are examined by holding them between the thumb and middle finger. One should consider visiting a doctor, on development of any type of lump (nodule) around the testicles. Furthermore, the doctor may perform some more tests such as such as X-Ray scan and biopsy, etc. in order to confirm the disease.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>This disease is very much curable in its early stage. Similar to most of the other types of cancers, it can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, medication, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, nutritional therapy, interferon/interleukin, etc. Surgery is used to remove the infected testicle from the affected person's body (other infected tissues are also removed during the surgery). Medication can be used to destroy the remaining infected cells and help to regain strength after the surgery. The type and combination of various treatments to be followed would be decided by the physician, based on the stage that this disease is in and the complexity involved.</p> <p>However, there are certain side effects of various treatments such as destruction of uninfected cells after radiotherapy; the affected person might experience lethargy due to high power medication etc. Furthermore, it is very important to pay attention to the affected person's diet and take proper medication after the cancer treatment.</p> <h3>How Should One Minimize the Risk of Cancer?</h3> <p>1) Quit smoking, as smokers are at the highest risk level of developing any type of cancer.<br>2) Try to include vegetables and fruits in the daily diet and avoid junk or processed food.<br>3) Try to avoid toxic substances such as chemicals etc. Take the necessary precautions before one handles such things.<br>4) Exercise regularly and stay fit.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Stomach cancer is one of the most common types of cancers. Almost one million people get diagnosed with this condition every year. The following article provides information about the various symptoms of this condition.</p> <h3>Stomach Cancer</h3> <p>Stomach cancer develops in the mucous-producing cells present in the inner lining of the stomach. These cells are also known as adenocercinomas. This condition mostly affects older people. Almost two third of people with stomach cancer are 65 or above. It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the world.</p> <h3>Who is at Risk?</h3> <p>People who eat less or no vegetables, and consume more preservative-added foods or junk foods are at higher risk of developing stomach cancer. Also people in their old age (people of age group 65 and above) are at higher risk of developing this condition.</p> <p>Apart from this, people who are affected by (or those who had history of) certain types of diseases such as achlorhydria, pernicious anemia, and bacterial infections of stomach (<i>Helicobacter pylori</i>) may also develop this condition. People who smoke are also at high risk of developing stomach cancer.<br /><br /><span>In some cases, it has been observed that this condition can be hereditary.</span></p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>There are quite a couple of tests used to detect this type of cancer in patients, however, endoscopy is highly trusted one. Blood sample test and biopsy (samples of cells from the inside lining of the stomach are taken) may also be performed in order to find out any abnormalities. In endoscopy, a small robotic tool is used to take pictures of the inside of the stomach to find out any abnormal growth which may cause this condition.</p> <p>Ultrasound scanning can also be used to diagnose stomach cancer. Barium meal (white barium liquid) test can also be performed to diagnose this disease in which once the liquid is consumed by the patient, the patient's stomach is examined using X-rays. Along with the aforementioned techniques, there are many other screening tests available for diagnosis of stomach cancer such as gastroscopy, biopsy, and microscopy.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>It shows very little or almost no symptoms in its early stage. Occasionally, the patient may experience a very light stomach ache. Once the cancer starts growing, the patient may experience severe stomach ache, loss of weight due to loss of appetite, blood in stool, bloating problem (or bloated feeling) after eating anything, and abdominal pain and discomfort.</p> <p>Any type of change in bowel habits, Ascites, jaundice, and nausea are few other symptoms that make life difficult for the patient. With time new techniques are also being invented to confirm the growth of stomach cancer.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Like any other type of cancer, treatment options for this condition also involve chemotherapy, surgery, and medication. In most cases, surgery is performed to remove a part of or the entire stomach. Success of the surgery depends on the stage in which the cancer is detected (which is very low as most of the cases are diagnosed in advanced stage of stomach cancer).</p> <p>At times, the treatment may include a combination of surgery and medication to help eliminate carcinogenic cells from the body after a surgery to remove infected part of the stomach or the entire stomach. Radiotherapy and biological therapy (also known as immunological therapy) are also used to destroy cancerous cells from the patient's body. Along with the aforementioned treatment methods, there are many other methods and drugs currently under trial.</p> <p>Most of the treatments specified above show significant side effects on the patient's health, hence it is very important to follow a proper diet regime and medication in order to cope up with the problems caused by those side effects.</p> <h3>How Should I Minimize My Risk of Stomach Cancer?</h3> <p>1) Quit smoking, as smokers are at the highest risk level of developing any type of cancer.<br>2) Try to include vegetables and fruits in your daily diet, and avoid junk or processed food.<br>3) Try to avoid interaction with toxic substances such as chemicals, etc. Take necessary precautions before you handle such things.<br>4) Exercise regularly in order to stay fit and active.</p>"

Hence, it is very important to remove the infected tissues (gangrenous tissues) from the patient's body.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Necrotizing fasciitis can be visible on the surface when the bacteria start destroying tissues and fascia that are near the skin surface or around any bruise or cut. The patient may experience the following symptoms (if necrotizing fasciitis is underneath the skin, it can become very hard to tell all the symptoms).<ol><li>The person experiences unbearable pain in the area that is infected and where the bacteria is active.</li><li>Patient may experience nausea and confusion.</li><li>High fever.</li><li>Extremely low blood pressure due to the confusion and other problems.</li><li>Dehydration due to the existence of toxins and enzymes produced by the bacteria in the body.</li><li>The infected area becomes red, starts swelling and patient experiences burning sensation in that region.</li></ol><b>Diagnosis</b><br>Diagnosis is done based on the symptoms the patient is experiencing and a blood sample test. Sample of the infected tissues can also be taken for a biopsy. Many times, the symptoms are misunderstood with those of other diseases if necrotizing fasciitis is spreading under the skin and not visible outside. This may lead to a delay in treatment and possible death of the patient.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>As there is no vaccine available against this bacteria, it is very important to remove the infected tissues by surgery. If the disease is diagnosed in its preliminary stage, i.e., before it starts spreading deeper, surgical removal of the infected tissues can save an infected individual. If the disease has spread deeper and to a larger part of the body, limb amputation may be required to be carried out. Along with the surgery, medication (antibiotics) is very important to help the patient fight the infection and strengthen the immune system.</p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p>You should immediately consult your doctor if you experience any of the symptoms enlisted above. All those who come in contact with a patient suffering from this disease, those who are suffering from chronic diseases, and people who have a weakened immune system should be careful about the possible infection, and if possible, they should consult a doctor about the same.</p> <p><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be replaced for the advice of a medical professional.</i></span></p>"

Let's learn more on this subject in this HealthHearty article.</p> <p>Skin cancer is caused due to the malfunctioning and uncontrolled growth of cells on the lining of skin. Change in color/appearance of skin or development of sores (which do not heal) is a clear indication of possible skin cancer. One such type is the <i>Melanoma skin cancer</i>.<br><br>It is the most severe type of skin cancer. It starts from the skin cells named <i>melanocytes</i>, which are responsible for the production of melanin. Melanin gives our skin its color and also protects our skin cells from ultraviolet rays. Once we come into direct contact with ultraviolet rays, our skin cells (melanocytes) start producing more melanin, which causes tanning of our skin.<br><br>If our skin remains exposed to ultraviolet rays for a long time, the melanocytes may start malfunctioning and grow abnormally. This growth can lead to cancer, and thus, is called <i>melanoma</i>.<br><br>n<div><strong>Who is at Risk of Developing Melanoma?</strong></div>n<br>n<div>People who come into direct contact with too much of ultraviolet radiation, people having problem with the melanin production, and those who are fair-skinned and have light-colored eyes (it has been recorded that melatocytes in fair-skinned people fail to produce sufficient quantity of melanin pigments, hence, there is less protection against harmful UV rays), people with skin problems, and those who have hereditary skin problems are at a high risk of developing this disease. Also, people who have large number of moles on skin, people with weakened immune system, and those who have blistering sunburns on their skin are at a high risk of developing melanoma.</div>n<br>n<div><strong>Symptoms</strong></div>n<br>n<div>You should consult your doctor if you witness any of the following symptoms:n<ul>n<li>Spots on the skin that grow and never heal, and are multicolored in nature.</li>n<li>Moles that keep on growing, and start itching and change in color or texture (such unusual moles are also known as dysplastic nevi).</li>n<li>Bleeding sores that grow and last for longer time (about a month or more) and reappear after getting healed.</li>n<li>For men, generally moles, spots, and sores develop on the outer skin such as face, hands, etc., while in women, they grow underneath their palms, fingernails, and toenails</li>n</ul>n</div>n<br>n<div><strong>Types of Melanoma</strong></div>n<br>n<div><strong>Superficial Spreading Melanoma (SSM)</strong></div>nThis is the most common type of skin cancer. It takes about a year or more to spread through the upper skin when it is in its first phase called radial phase. During the first phase, it spreads horizontally and is less threatening. During the second phase, it starts growing vertically making it more dangerous of two phases and is hard to treat.<br>n<div><strong>Nodular Melanoma (NM)</strong></div>nThis type appears very rapidly and is considered to be the most deadliest/dangerous of the four types. The direction of this cancer is upward and inward through the skin and body, which makes it more intense and deadly. It generally appears on the legs, arms, head, and neck area in light-skinned people.<br>n<div><strong>Acral Lentigous Melanoma (ALM)</strong></div>nThis type of cancer is common in people with dark skin and it starts appearing on nails, palms, etc. This type of melanoma is also aggressive in nature, and by the time we can diagnose it, it reaches its advanced stage. This type of cancer starts growing across the skin and penetrates it.<br>n<div><strong>Lentigo Maligna Melanoma (LMM)</strong></div>nPeople from the age group of 65 years and above are generally prone to develop LMM, which is also the least common of all the four melanomas. This cancer targets nose and cheeks, and spreads very slowly across the skin. It is least threatening and does not spread across the body or other tissues.<br><br>n<div><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></div>n<br>n<div>In most of the cases melanoma can be diagnosed simply by examining the infected area (it includes self-examination and examination performed by doctor). This is further accompanied by tests such as epiluminescence microscopy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.<br><br>Similar to any other type of cancer, melanoma treatment also involves surgery (in which the tumor and infected tissues from surrounding area are removed), immunotherapy (in which patient is given immune-stimulating chemical (interferon) to help strengthen immune system and fight cancer), chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc. Some vaccines are also currently under trial to help destroy cancer tumors and help a patient's immune system to fight cancer.</div>n<br>People should be careful about overexposure to ultraviolet rays when going for tanning and should be watchful for any symptoms of skin cancer.</p>"

Almost 70% of the cases of skin cancer are of basal cell carcinomas. Basal cell carcinoma mainly starts growing/developing on the area which is exposed to ultra-violet rays such as neck, head, face, back, hands etc. It has been recorded that the basal cell carcinoma does not spread in the lymph nodes and other parts of the body if treated before its advanced stage. This cancer can re-appear after treatment or has higher chances of developing on other parts of the skin.</p> <p><b>Squamous Cell Carcinoma:</b> This type of skin cancer is more harmful and aggressive than basal cell carcinoma and is the second most common type of skin cancers. Almost 20 to 25% cases of all the skin cancers are of squamous cell carcinoma. Similar to basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma also appears on the part of the body that is exposed to UV rays. It can also develop in scars, blistering and ulcers. This type of cancer can spread to the other parts/organs of the body and the tissues surrounding the infected area.</p> <p><b>Kaposi's Sarcoma:</b> This type of skin cancer starts growing in the dermis and mainly targets people with weakened immune system such as people suffering from AIDS. In this type of cancer, the tumor starts growing from the connective tissues. This is a rare type of skin cancer. </p> <p><b>Markel Cell Carcinoma:</b> This type of skin cancer starts growing from neuroendocrine cells. Markel cell carcinoma can spread to any part of the body and can re-appear once treated. This is also a rare type skin cancer.</p> <p><b>Cutaneous Lymphomas:</b> Cutaneous lymphoma starts with the increase of T and B lymphocytes and it develops entirely on the skin.</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>In most cases, non-melanoma can be diagnosed simply by examining the infected area (it includes self-examination and examination performed by doctor). This is further accompanied by tests such as biopsy which is a test done taking a sample of skin tissue.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Similar to any other types of cancers, non-melanoma skin cancer treatment also involves surgery (in which the tumor and infected tissues from the surrounding area are removed), immunotherapy (in which patient is given immune-stimulating chemical (interferon) to help strengthen immune system and fight cancer), chemotherapy, radiotherapy, Moh's Micrographic Surgery, Cryosurgery, curettage and desiccation, etc. Some vaccines are also currently under trial to help destroy cancer tumors and help strengthen the patient's immune system to fight cancer.</p> <p>People should be careful about over-exposure to ultra-violet rays when going for tanning and should be watchful for any symptoms of skin cancer.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Hemophilia disease is a kind of genetic blood disorders due to malfunction in the blood clotting factors. As the clotting doesn't take place properly, it often results into anemia and death. The following article provides information about the various symptoms and treatment options available for this condition.</p> <p>Hemophilia is a recessive genetic disorder linked to the X-chromosome. The condition develops due to the deficiency of one of the three clotting factors, that are clotting factor 8, 9, or 11. The blood does not clot properly and therefore any injuries that result in a cut may lead to death due to bleeding. It has been called the <b>royal disease</b> because it suddenly showed up as a genetic mutation in Queen Victoria (1819-1901) of Britain. She was a carrier and passed it on to her eighth son Leopold and thus to her descendants and many other royal families of Europe.</p> <h3>What is Hemophilia?</h3> <p>Hemophilia is a rare blood disorder that is linked to the X-chromosome. The X and Y chromosomes are the genetic material that determines the gender of the child. Women have two X chromosomes and men have a set of X and Y chromosomes. The X chromosome carries the gene which have the information for the clotting factors.</p> <p>Therefore, women are only carriers of this blood disorder, and they pass it on to their sons. 50% of the children of a couple where a woman is a carrier and a man is not afflicted with the disease will either get the disease (sons) or become carriers of the disease (daughters). In case where the man is afflicted with the disease, the girls will be carriers, but his sons will not get the disease. However, this happens very rarely as a male is not able to survive till maturity.</p> <p>There are two types of hemophilia, A and B. The former (also called factor VIII deficiency and classic hemophilia) is the more common of the two. This disease is caused due to lack of a certain protein that is necessary for the production of a major component in the clotting process known as factor VIII. With this disease small cuts or bruises are not a problem. Though the major problems are caused by traumatic injuries that lead to continuous bleeding.</p> <p>Hemophilia B, also known as \"Christmas disease\" (named after the first person diagnosed with it in 1952) or factor IX deficiency, is caused due to deficiency of blood clotting factor IX. This condition is the second most prevalent type of hemophilia. In about 30% of the cases, the condition id not inherited and is caused due to spontaneous mutation.</p> <h2>Symptoms</h2> <p>The most common symptom is bleeding and bruising. There are various degrees of bleding which are explained below.</p> <h3>Mild hemophilia (factor levels of 6%-49%)</h3> <p>These patients experience significant bleeding only after major injury or other causes of bleeding such as trauma or surgery. Often this degree of hemophilia will not be found until an injury causes excessive bleeding (sometimes not even until adulthood).</p> <h3>Moderate hemophilia</h3> <p>People affected with this condition often bruise easily. A knock or a fall causes them to bleed around the joints. The commonly affected joints are elbow and knee joint. Initially the person may feel tightness in the joint, but later on the joint may become swollen and hard to bend. Also, the pain increases which may disrupt the movement of the joint temporarily.</p> <h3>Severe hemophilia</h3> <p>These people bleed spontaneously frequently and frequently. They bleed without any apparent reason, and the bleeding may take the form of nosebleed, joint bleed, muscle bleed, etc.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>In America there are specialized hemophilia treatment centers (HTC's) that have specialists that cover a multitude of concerns that would be able to assist people with this and other blood disorders. The people working in this center are social workers, hematologists (both adult and pediatric), dentists, gynecologists, and several others.</p> <p>For those with mild hemophilia, small cuts and scrapes are treated normally. Additionally, a non-blood product is added (DDAVP) to treat minor bleeding incidents. Major bleeding incidents or bleeding into the joints and muscles are treated by giving the patient the missing factor (VIII or IX). This is the only way to solve these problems.</p> <p>For major bleeding injuries, The Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the National Hemophilia Foundation has recommended usage of recombinant blood products. These are blood factors made with products that are produced in a lab as opposed to donated blood products. These products are recommended because they tend to be safer, and the chance of getting AIDS is greatly diminished since transfusion of donated blood products has been known to cause AIDS. It is recommended that people affected with severe hemophilia (both A and B) should be administered regular preventive doses of the missing factors.</p> <p>In rare circumstances (more with hemophilia A, than with B) there is a possibility of adverse reactions (either allergic reactions or resistance to the standard treatment factor). In such cases it is important to inform your doctor or health treatment center (HTC).</p>"

This article highlights the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis.</p> <p>Infectious Mononucleosis is a viral disease caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The virus is spread through saliva, and in rare instances, through blood transfusion. It is mostly diagnosed in adolescents and young adults, mostly in the age groups of 15 to 17. It is not a fatal disease, and the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis resolve within a month or two.</p> <h3>Alternative Names</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Mono</li>n<li>Glandular fever</li>n<li>The kissing disease</li>n<li>Pfeiffer's disease</li>n</ul></p> <h2>Symptoms</h2> <h3>Initial Stages</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Sudden loss of appetite</li>n<li>Sudden lack of energy</li>n<li>Chills</li>n<li>Puffy and swollen eyes</li>n</ul>nThese initial signs last from 1 to 3 days after which the following more pronounced ones appear.</p> <h3>Later Stages</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Severe sore throat</li>n<li>High fever</li>n<li>Swollen neck lymph glands</li>n</ul>nUsually, the sore throat is so severe that the person is forced to visit the physician.</p> <h3>Other Indications</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Very red throat</li>n<li>Very red tonsils or tonsils having a white coating</li>n<li>Swollen neck lymph glands</li>n<li>Almost half of those suffering will have an enlarged or swollen spleen</li>n<li>In some cases, the liver could be enlarged</li>n<li>Mild jaundice</li>n<li>Few will get a red rash just like measles all over the body</li>n<li>Headache</li>n<li>Depression</li>n<li>Dizziness</li>n<li>Dry irritating cough</li>n<li>Weakness</li>n<li>Body pain</li>n</ul></p> <p>The symptoms will usually resolve within a month or two, but the EBV could remain dormant in a few cells of the throat or in the blood for life.</p> <p>Most of the people who have had this problem once are not at risk of the infection again when they come in contact with someone who could spread it. It is believed that the spreading of this infection is rare through blood or saliva in the air (coughing, sneezing), and requires a more direct contact with the infected saliva.</p> <p>The time from infection to appearance of the symptoms (incubation period) varies from 4 to 6 weeks. Persons infected could spread it even during this period without knowing it. The culprit virus is also sometimes found in perfectly healthy persons from where it can spread to others. Due to these reasons, containing the virus and infection is not possible.</p> <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2> <p>Diagnosis is usually based on reported symptoms along with a physical examination. If there is doubt in the physicians mind, a white blood cell count or an antibody test could be conducted. The common tests for EBV could include one or more of the following.n<ul>n<li>Monospot Test (Positive for Infectious Mononucleosis)</li>n<li>Epstein-Barr virus antigen by immunofluorescence (Positive for EBV)</li>n<li>Epstein-Barr virus antibody titers to help distinguish acute infection from past infection with EBV</li>n</ul></p> <p>The treatment usually adapted consists of corticosteroids for reducing the swelling of the throat and tonsils. Besides this sufficient rest is advised so as to facilitate the body's immune system to destroy the virus and regain lost strength.</p> <p>During this time, the symptoms can be relived by a warm water gargle to relieve the sore throat, and drinking plenty of warm fluids.</p> <p>In most of the cases, there is no need to worry. The fever should go within 10 days and the swollen lymph glands and spleen (if swollen) should heal perfectly within 4 to 5 weeks.</p> <p>If you are aware that someone close to you is infected with 'mono', avoid kissing (even a mild peck) and sharing the same utensils; you may just save yourself from contracting the disease.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

However, these chemicals are not devoid of side effects. The current article gives a brief description of the possible side effects and allergies due to these supplements.</p> <p>Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are important structural components of cartilage, a flexible connective tissue present in joints, intervertebral discs, rib cage, ears, and nose. Glucosamine is a type of amino sugar, whereas chondroitin sulfate belongs to the family of glycosaminoglycans. These two carbohydrate moieties are not only responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of cartilage, but also regulate a variety of cellular processes. They are synthesized in the body naturally from glucose. However, with increasing age, the capacity to produce glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate decreases, leading to deterioration of cartilaginous tissues, especially in the knees. The tissue hardens, forming bone spurs which cause immense pain, and limits joint movement.</p> <p>Since glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are not present directly in any food source, commercially available supplements are the only source. Such supplements have gained widespread use for the treatment of osteoarthritis (the most common type of arthritis). Studies have shown that they are similar or better than any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug. It has been noted that glucosamine supplements have helped persons suffering from osteoarthritis by stimulating cartilage repair, and bringing about increased lubrication in the joints, thereby reducing joint pain.</p> <p><div><strong>Side Effects</strong></div>n<br><span>\u27a9</span> <span>As per the risk assessment studies, the observed safety levels for the intake of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are 2000 mg/day and 1200 mg/day, respectively. These are the highest levels tested in human clinical trials.</span></p> <p>There certain mild side effects have been observed in certain individuals. The most common side effects observed are:</p> <p>\u2022 Headache<br>\u2022 Flatulence<br>\u2022 Abdominal discomfort<br>\u2022 Nausea<br>\u2022 Gastrointestinal pain<br>\u2022 Diarrhea<br>\u2022 Vertigo<br>\u2022 Insomnia</p> <p><span>\u27a9</span> <i>Caution for Diabetics</i><br>Patients with diabetes who have been prescribed such supplements are advised to keep a strict check over their insulin and blood sugar levels. Research conducted to evaluate the effect of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate on blood glucose levels has revealed contradictory results. Certain studies render these supplements as safe for diabetics, whereas a few studies have shown diverse metabolic interventions, leading to increased blood glucose levels.</p> <p><span>\u27a9</span> <i>Other Adverse Effects</i><br>Isolated cases have been reported where glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplementation led to severe kidney inflammation, liver inflammation, and asthma exacerbation. A few cases have demonstrated adverse interactions of these supplements with anticoagulant medicines and blood-thinning agents like warfarin.</p> <p>In addition to this, the effects of these chemicals on developing fetus are not yet clearly known. Hence, pregnant women, and those attempting to conceive, as well as breastfeeding mothers are advised against the use of these supplements.</p> <p><div><strong>Allergies</strong></div>n<br>The commercially available supplements are derived from crabs, lobsters and other shellfish, as well as shark cartilage. Hence, atopic individuals and individuals allergic to shellfish may develop hypersensitivity reactions. They may suffer from <b>throat swelling, skin rash, or edema</b>. However, certain contradictory studies state that the level of allergens in these supplements is clinically insignificant, and hence pose no harm to such individuals.</p> <p>Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplements serve as analgesics for osteoarthritis patients. But, the age at which the need for such supplementation arises is seldom devoid of any other malady. Owing to this, as well as the contradictory results pertaining to certain adverse effects, it is ideal to seek consultation and approval from your doctor.</p> <p><i>Disclaimer: This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for the advice of a registered medical practitioner.</i></p>"

Getting yourself diagnosed for mesothelioma if you have been exposed to asbestos could help contain the cancer and even prolong your life.</p> <h3>What is Mesothelioma?</h3> <p>Mesothelioma is a rare form of cancer of the membrane (mesothelium) that lines the lungs, abdomen or heart.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>Even though mesothelioma is a not so common cancer, it is however common among those who have constantly been exposed to asbestos because it is the only known and established cause of mesothelioma.</p> <p>Asbestos inhalation accounts for over 80% of all diagnosed mesothelioma. There have been instances when there was no clear link between asbestos and mesothelioma, leading to the conclusion that the cause was something else.</p> <p>Tests in certain cases of mesothelioma where there was no relation with asbestos has revealed that the culprit could possibly be radiation from certain x-rays given in the 1950s that contained the chemical thorium dioxide.</p> <p>Tests in those suffering from mesothelioma in Turkey pointed to exposure to the chemical zeolite.</p> <p>These two cases are very rare with diagnosis almost always confirming the cause as asbestos exposure.</p> <p>Asbestos was discovered as a cause of mesothelioma because almost all the people first diagnosed with this disease were either asbestos miners, construction workers, building renovators, ship builders, ship breakers, or those working with automobile clutch and brake assemblies. All those involved in these professions had one thing in common - Asbestos Exposure.</p> <p>Mesothelioma is a latent disease that can take anything between 30 to 40 years to surface after the initial exposure. This is one of the prime reasons that it is almost always diagnosed very late when a total cure is impossible.</p> <h3>Individuals at Maximum Risk of Mesothelioma</h3> <p>People at a greater risk of mesothelioma are those who have been constantly exposed to asbestos. Many of those suffering from mesothelioma today do not even know it, since the signs and symptoms of the disease surface three to four decades after the initial exposure.</p> <p>Following individuals are at a maximum risk of mesothelioma.</p> <p>-- Workers in asbestos mines<br>-- People living in proximity to asbestos mines<br>-- Workers in the construction industry who handle material containing asbestos<br>-- Workers of asbestos removal companies who were in direct contact with asbestos dust<br>-- Workers responsible for house/building renovations<br>-- Workers involved in ship building<br>-- Workers involved in ship renovation<br>-- Workers involved in ship breaking<br>-- People who come into direct contact with any of the above mentioned workers, especially their friends and family members. Fine asbestos particles that are not seen with the naked eye get lodged in their hair and clothing and can be inhaled by individuals coming in contact with them.</p> <p>If you have been working in any of the above mentioned categories, or suspect that you have been exposed to asbestos inhalation or ingestion in the 60s or later, please visit a physician/surgeon who specializes in mesothelioma. You could be feeling absolutely healthy today, but the deadly mesothelioma could slowly be building up to incurable proportions.</p> <p>There are many out there who know for sure that they have been exposed to asbestos for prolonged periods, but avoid going to the physician because of the feeling that its 10, 20, or even 30 years since exposure, and nothing could possibly happen now. Asbestos exposure can take up to 40 (sometimes even 50) years after exposure, to surface.</p> <p>There are tests that the physician/surgeon will perform to diagnose the presence of asbestos and the impending mesothelioma. If diagnosed early (which happens very rarely) the surgeon may be able to stop the spread of the cancer, ensuring you live a longer, healthier life.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Morbid obesity is a serious health problem that poses several health risks. The following HealthHearty write-up provides information on the surgery for morbid obesity.</p> <p>Morbid obesity is a serious condition that puts a person at the risk of developing serious medical conditions. An individual is considered to be morbidly obese, if he/she has the Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 or more, or weighs 100 pounds over his/her ideal body weight. If a person has a BMI of 35 or more, and he/she is affected by at least two other serious health problems, and he/she is not able to lose weight under any circumstance, then he/she is a suitable candidate for weight loss surgery. As with other surgeries, certain risks are associated with these surgeries, but these also offer several health benefits.</p> <h3>Surgical Procedures for Morbid Obesity</h3> <p>People who are morbidly obese are certainly at an increased risk of developing back pain, joint problems, cardiovascular problems, etc. There are certain surgical procedures that can eliminate some, if not all of these problems. Here's some information about some of the surgical procedures.</p> <h3>Gastric Bypass</h3> <p>In this surgery, a small portion of the stomach is separated and stapled. The food bypasses the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), and directly enters the jejunum. This causes malabsorption of fat, which in turn will prevent the person from gaining weight. The main advantage of this surgery is that more weight is lost. In addition, nearly all the health problems caused by the excess weight are resolved by the surgical procedure. Though a gastric bypass surgery can help a person attain his/her ideal weight, certain risks are associated with this surgery. These include stretching of the stomach due to not following the recommended dietary guidelines. There's also the issue of malabsorption of essential nutrients, as the food bypasses the duodenum. Though the risk of infection is minimal in case of laparoscopic surgery, the possibility of infection cannot be completely ruled out. Some of the other risks include bleeding, blood clot formation, decreased absorption of nutrients, and intestinal obstruction.</p> <h3>Lap Band\u00ae Adjustable Gastric Banding</h3> <p>The aim of this surgery is to restrict the food intake. In this surgery, a gastric band device is placed around the upper section of the stomach, from where the food enters from the esophagus. The band is connected to a port under the skin in the abdomen. The port is used to add saline, which tightens the band, thereby reducing the size of the size of stomach. The reduced size of the stomach gives rise to the feeling of fullness, which in turn lowers the food intake. Weight loss is achieved, as only a controlled amount of food can be allowed into the stomach.</p> <p>As far as the benefits of this surgery are concerned, it is a minimally-invasive procedure that leaves the organs intact. There is no malabsorption of nutrients or food or water. There's no re-routing of any digestive organs, which is why there's no chance for post-surgical bleeding or intestinal obstruction. If required, this procedure can be reversed.</p> <p>However, there are some risks associated with this surgery. The lap band\u00ae is a foreign object and there is a possibility for it to move, slip, or affect the organs. Nausea, vomiting, and constant hunger are also possible.</p> <p>On a concluding note, the aforementioned surgical procedures offer health benefits, but certain risks are involved as well. The procedure must be performed if the benefits outweigh the risks.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>The information provided in this article is solely for educating the reader.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Mesothelioma was diagnosed using x-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans. Today, most surgeons prefer using the PET scan for its accuracy and ability to show the internal organs/skeletal structure in fine detail.</p> <h3>Complications of Diagnosing Mesothelioma</h3> <p>The diagnosis of mesothelioma is not easy and usually involves many complications.</p> <p>A diagnosis for mesothelioma may point toward some other disease or condition because of the similarity between mesothelioma and many minor diseases/conditions such as the common cold and seasonal allergies.</p> <p>In quite a few cases mesothelioma could be diagnosed as lung cancer which also involves the lungs, but is a totally different type of cancer from mesothelioma.</p> <h3>Mesothelioma Diagnosing Techniques</h3> <p>A diagnosis for mesothelioma will usually begin with the physician/surgeon reviewing a complete medical history of the patient. This is followed by a thorough physical examination depending upon the mesothelioma signs and symptoms described by the patient. The signs and symptoms could include shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing caused by lung compression, mild to severe constant pain in the chest, lungs surrounded by excess fluid, fatigue caused without any apparent reason, blood traces in the sputum, sudden unexplained weight loss, constant pain (mild to excessive) in the abdomen, swelling of the abdomen, sudden noticeable change in bowel movement with constant diarrhea or constipation, and tissue lumps in the abdomen.</p> <p>The physical tests will include imaging tests to search for and determine cancerous cells/formation. These imaging tests could include one or more of the following.</p> <p>-- X-rays<br>-- CAT / CT scan<br>-- MRI scan<br>-- PET scan</p> <p>Other tests to determine mesothelioma by means of a biopsy could include the following.</p> <p>-- Thoracoscopy<br>-- Peritoneoscopy</p> <h3>Using X-rays</h3> <p>A chest or an abdomen x-ray will allow the physician/surgeon to see through layers of skin and surface tissue. The x-rays show fluid/mass build-up and help in determining any incidence of mesothelioma in the lungs, abdomen, or heart.</p> <p>X-rays are one of the oldest methods of diagnosing mesothelioma and come with a few flaws. The x-rays are known to miss the tiny growths that are caused in mesothelioma, leading to further delay in correct diagnosis and possibly endangering the life of the patient.</p> <h3>Using CAT/CT Scan</h3> <p>CT/CAT (computed axial tomography) scans are basically three dimensional x-rays that are able to project extremely detailed internal pictures of the organs, bones and skeletal structures. CT scan is a method of combining images from multiple x-rays using a computer to reproduce cross sectional or three-dimensional pictures of internal organs. It is useful in determining the location and spread of mesothelioma. They are much more accurate in detail than the x-ray, helping the physician/surgeon make a more accurate diagnosis. One of the drawbacks of CT scans is that it cannot differentiate between benign or malignant mesothelioma.</p> <h3>Using MRI Scan</h3> <p>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans are more sophisticated than the x-ray and CT scans. It makes use of high magnetic fields and radio waves, and with the help of a computer give physicians/surgeons a clear picture of the internal organs and skeletal structure. MRI scans are extremely clear and very useful in detecting mesothelioma related soft tissue growths and determining the severity of the tumor.</p> <h3>Using PET Scans</h3> <p>PET (positron emission tomography) imaging is the best and most widely used imaging technology for diagnosing mesothelioma. PET scans use cameras and tracers that form images to indicate biological changes which are able to detect extremely small cancerous tumors. They are much superior in their image quality and details when compared to x-rays, CAT scans, and even MRI scans. PET scans also help the physician/surgeon in determining the staging of the cancer.</p> <h3>Thoracoscopy</h3> <p>Thoracoscopy is a process where the surgeon will make a small incision in the chest wall and insert an instrument known as a thoracoscope (fitted with a miniature camera and light) to examine and obtain a tissue sample for further biopsy.</p> <h3>Peritoneoscopy</h3> <p>Peritoneoscopy is a process where the surgeon will make a small incision in the abdomen to extract a sample tissue for further biopsy.</p> <h3>What After a Positive Mesothelioma Diagnosis</h3> <p>Once diagnosed with mesothelioma even the strongest in heart and mind can become weak. The current survival time after positive diagnosis is just 12 to 18 months (some will not even survive this long).</p> <p>There is some soothing news for persons who will be positively diagnosed for mesothelioma in the future. New tests and medications which are very promising are undergoing trial and should get the survival time after diagnosis to a minimum of 5 years or more. With rapid advancements in technology, the survival time after mesothelioma diagnosis will just keep getting better and better.</p>"

They consist of the Butchart Staging System (oldest, but still in use), the TNM Staging System (recent and most widely used today), and the Brigham Staging System (latest system which can check if the mesothelioma is still resectable)</p> <p>Mesothelioma is a rare type of cancer that affects the mesothelium (lining surrounding the lungs, abdomen, or heart). The main cause of mesothelioma is direct or indirect asbestos exposure. During asbestos exposure microscopic (unseen by the eye) asbestos fibers enter the body either through inhalation or ingestion, causing healthy body cells to mutate into cancer (mesothelioma) over a period of time.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Treatments available today for mesothelioma are surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and a combination of the three.</p> <p>The most common type of mesothelioma treatment is surgery, followed by radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. If required a combination of these treatments are used.</p> <h3>Choosing the Type of Treatment</h3> <p>The physician/surgeon will decide on which type of mesothelioma treatment to choose from. This will depend on what type of mesothelioma it is, the patients age and health, and most importantly at what stage the cancer has been diagnosed.</p> <h3>Staging</h3> <p>Since the most common type of mesothelioma is pleural mesothelioma, it is the most studied and is the only type of mesothelioma for which there is a staging system.</p> <p>Once mesothelioma is diagnosed, further tests will be conducted to find out if the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, and to what extent. The stage of the cancer must be known for suitable treatment to be started.</p> <p>Different systems are in use for mesothelioma staging which consist of the following.</p> <p>-- Butchart Staging System<br>-- TNM Staging System<br>-- Brigham Staging System</p> <h2>Butchart Staging System</h2> <p>The Butchart system is the oldest and was the most commonly used staging system for mesothelioma. It is based on the extent of the primary tumor mass and divides the cancer into four stages; stages I through IV.</p> <p><strong>Stage I</strong><br />In stage I, cancer (mesothelioma) cells are present in the right or left pleura and at times also in the lung, pericardium, or the muscle separating the chest from the abdomen (diaphragm), all on the same side.</p> <p><strong>Stage II</strong><br />In stage II, cancer (mesothelioma) cells invade the chest wall involving the esophagus, heart, or pleura on both the sides. It could also involve the lymph nodes in the chest.</p> <p><strong>Stage III</strong><br />In stage III, the cancer (mesothelioma) has spread and penetrated through the diaphragm into the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). It could also involve the lymph nodes present beyond those in the chest.</p> <p><strong>Stage IV</strong><br />In stage IV, the cancer (mesothelioma) has spread into the bloodstream and to distant organs and tissues.</p> <h2>TNM Staging System</h2> <p>The TNM (T=Tumor, N=Nodes, M=Metastasis) system is based on the Butchart system, but is more detailed and precise with a few minor differences between both the systems.</p> <p>In TNM, T stands for the tumor size and how far it has spread, N stands for the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes, and M stands for the spread of the cancer to distant organs (metastasis). As in the Butchart staging system, the severity of the cancer is divided into four stages in the TNM system; I through IV.</p> <p><strong>Stage I</strong><br />In stage I, cancer (mesothelioma) cells are present in the right or left pleura and at times also in the lung, pericardium, or the muscle separating the chest from the abdomen (diaphragm), all on the same side.</p> <p><strong>Stage II</strong><br />In stage II, cancer (mesothelioma) has spread from the pleura on one side to the lymph nodes on the same side next to the lungs and also possibly into the lung, pericardium or the diaphragm on the same side.</p> <p><strong>Stage III</strong><br />In stage III, cancer (mesothelioma) has spread into the chest wall muscle, esophagus, heart, ribs, and other organs in the chest on the same side as the primary tumor.</p> <p><strong>Stage IV</strong><br />In stage IV, cancer (mesothelioma) has spread to the lymph nodes in the chest on the opposite side of the primary tumor, and could also include the pleura or lung on the opposite side, the peritoneum, organs in the abdominal cavity or neck. The cancer could have spread into the bloodstream taking the cancer to distant organs beyond the chest and abdominal cavity.</p> <h2>Brigham Staging System</h2> <p>The Brigham system is the most recent staging system for mesothelioma. It takes into consideration variables such as lymph node status and tumor resectability (the ability to surgically remove a tumor).</p> <p>The Brigham system too consists of four stages; I through IV.</p> <p><strong>Stage I</strong><br />In stage I, the cancer (mesothelioma) has not yet affected the lymph nodes and the mesothelioma is still resectable.</p> <p><strong>Stage II</strong><br />In stage II, the cancer (mesothelioma) has affected the lymph nodes, but it is still resectable.</p> <p><strong>Stage III</strong><br />In stage III, the cancer (mesothelioma) has penetrated the chest wall, diaphragm, heart, and abdominal cavity, with the lymph nodes either affected or unaffected. Mesothelioma is not resectable at this stage.</p> <p><strong>Stage IV</strong><br />In stage IV, the cancer (mesothelioma) has spread into the bloodstream and distant organs and tissues. Mesothelioma is not resectable at this stage.</p> <h2>Importance of Mesothelioma Staging</h2> <p>Staging plays a very important role in mesothelioma treatment because the physician/surgeon will base all further medications/treatment on the mesothelioma staging reports.</p> <p>To stage the extent of the cancer, the surgeon will require to get several x-rays/CT scan/MRI scan/PET scan or combination of these scans.</p> <p>It takes approximately 30 to 40 years for the symptoms of mesothelioma to surface. By this time the cancer is almost always in an advanced stage with no positive treatment possible and a survival rate of just 12 to 18 months after diagnosis. Surgeons today are testing new methods / medications to treat mesothelioma with promising results. It is expected that the survival rate after diagnosis will be up 5 to 10 years from the current 12 to 18 months. The survival time after diagnosis will just keep getting better and better.</p> <p>If you know that you have been exposed to asbestos in the past 40 years, but still feel fit and fine, what you can do today is to get a thorough checkup done from a physician/surgeon reputed in handling mesothelioma cases. As described in the article, you could be diagnosed with stage I mesothelioma, making cure and long life a possibility.</p>"

Survival time after diagnosis (which usually happens 30 to 40 years after initial asbestos exposure) is a mere 12 to 18 months, or even less in absence of treatment/medication.</p> <p>Mesothelioma is a cancer of the mesothelium, the membrane that surrounds the lungs, abdomen, and heart.</p> <p>Mesothelioma primarily consists of three types.</p> <p>-- Pleural Mesothelioma (cancer of the mesothelium surrounding the lungs)<br>-- Peritoneal Mesothelioma (cancer of the mesothelium surrounding the stomach)<br>-- Pericardial Mesothelioma (cancer of the mesothelium surrounding the heart)</p> <p>It takes approximately 30 to 40 years for mesothelioma to develop and show its effects. This is the prime reason why mesothelioma is mostly seen in older patients, mostly male.</p> <p>Mesothelioma is the most aggressive, painful, and fatal of all cancers.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>The prime cause of mesothelioma is asbestos exposure. There are extremely rare instances when it is noticed that asbestos exposure is not the culprit, but even in these exceptionally rare instances it is possible that the person has been exposed to asbestos (indirectly) without even knowing it.</p> <p>Even though mesothelioma is a very rare type of cancer, it is not so rare in those who have been exposed to asbestos.</p> <p>Asbestos exposure could happen directly or indirectly.</p> <p>Direct asbestos exposure happens when the person comes directly into contact with the asbestos fibers. Such persons could include asbestos mine workers, construction workers, building renovators, ship builders, ship breakers, clutch/brake liner workers/mechanics.</p> <p>Indirect asbestos exposure happens when the person comes into indirect contact with asbestos or if they come in contact with any person who has had direct asbestos exposure. Such people include family and friends of those who have been directly exposed to asbestos. Directly exposed individuals have asbestos fibers embedded into their hair and clothing, passing the asbestos fibers to all those who come into contact with them.</p> <p>A person need not be exposed to asbestos over long periods of time; even short term exposure could lead to mesothelioma.</p> <h3>What is Asbestos Exposure</h3> <p>Asbestos exposure occurs when a person is subjected to the inhalation/ingestion of unseen microscopic asbestos fibers over a period of time. When inhaled, the asbestos fibers settle and get firmly lodged into the lungs.</p> <p>Mesothelioma is the most common health effect caused by asbestos inhalation, but other health effects could include lung cancer and asbestosis. Mesothelioma is very different from these two, and should not be confused with lung cancer or asbestosis.</p> <h3>What is Pleural Mesothelioma</h3> <p>Pleural mesothelioma is the cancer affecting the lining that surrounds the lungs (pleura). It is the most common type of mesothelioma with over 80% of those diagnosed with mesothelioma suffering from it.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of pleural mesothelioma could include one or more of the following.</p> <p>-- Chest pain (mild to severe)<br>-- Shortness of breath<br>-- Retention of excess fluid around the lungs<br>-- Constant cough (mild to severe)<br>-- Constant wheezing while breathing<br>-- Traces of blood in the sputum</p> <h3>What is Peritoneal Mesothelioma</h3> <p>Peritoneal mesothelioma is the cancer affecting the lining that surrounds the stomach. It is a type of mesothelioma that is not very common with just 10 to 20% of those diagnosed with mesothelioma suffering from it.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of peritoneal mesothelioma could include one or more of the following.</p> <p>-- Constant pain in the abdomen (mild to severe)<br>-- Retention of excess fluid around the stomach<br>-- Tissue lumps in the abdomen<br>-- Constant diarrhea or constipation<br>-- Sudden unexplained weight loss<br>-- Nausea</p> <h3>What is Pericardial Mesothelioma</h3> <p>Pericardial mesothelioma is the cancer affecting the lining that surrounds the heart. It is the rarest type of mesothelioma with extremely few of those diagnosed with mesothelioma suffering from it.</p> <p>Signs and symptoms of pericardial mesothelioma could include one or more of the following.</p> <p>-- Chest pain (mild to severe)<br>-- Shortness of breath<br>-- Heart palpitations<br>-- Constant cough (mild to severe)</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>The diagnosis of mesothelioma is not easy since the symptoms overlap with many other common ailments such as pneumonia, the common cold, and seasonal allergies.</p> <p>After reviewing the patients complete medical history, the physician/surgeon will ask for further tests to be conducted if he suspects mesothelioma.</p> <p>The best way to determine mesothelioma is through imaging tests which could include one or more of the following.</p> <p>-- X-rays<br>-- CAT/CT Scan<br>-- MRI Scan<br>-- PET Scan</p> <p>Performing a biopsy is another way of confirming mesothelioma. These could include either a Thoracoscopy or a Peritoneoscopy.</p> <h3>Treating Mesothelioma</h3> <p>Treatment will depend entirely on the results of the tests performed. The physician/surgeon will take into consideration at what stage the cancer has been diagnosed, and the patients age/health.</p> <p>The most common type of treatment for mesothelioma is surgery, followed by radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A combination of these treatments could be used depending on the situation.</p> <p>A total cure for mesothelioma is not possible, with all treatments used to increase the life expectancy of the patient.</p> <h3>Is Mesothelioma Fatal?</h3> <p>Yes. Mesothelioma is fatal, always. It takes in between 30 to 40 years after initial exposure for mesothelioma to surface. Due to the nature of the disease, mesothelioma is almost always diagnosed when it has spread to incurable levels. At this stage, the patient will survive for just a further 12 to 18 months with treatment.</p> <h3>Better Cures/Treatment</h3> <p>There is currently a lot of research/focus on new ways and techniques to cure mesothelioma. Many treatments are at present undergoing clinical trials with promising results. If you suspect asbestos exposure in the past, consult your physician/surgeon. If diagnosed with mesothelioma, the surgeon will guide you on the latest techniques that are undergoing trial. You could volunteer to take part in these trials.</p> <p>All these modern treatments use the latest technologies and equipment available, but will still not guarantee total cure. Yes, what it could possibly do is increase the survival rate from a mere 12 to 18 months after diagnosis to a much longer time frame of about 5 to 10 years. During this time (5 to 10 years from now) better options could be available, further prolonging your life, possibly even curing the mesothelioma totally.</p>"

In current clinical trials, many new drugs are being combined with these methods to find the perfect treatment for mesothelioma.</p> <h2>Available Treatments</h2> <p>Once diagnosed with mesothelioma, the surgeon will go through the entire medical history of the patient and decide on the type of treatment and medication. This will depend entirely on the stage at which the mesothelioma is diagnosed, and the age/physical health of the patient.</p> <p><span>Treatments for mesothelioma could include one or more of the following.</span><br />-- Surgery<br />-- Radiation therapy<br />-- Chemotherapy</p> <h3>Surgery</h3> <p>Once diagnosed for mesothelioma, the surgeon could opt for surgery. Surgery is not a cure for mesothelioma, but helps alleviate the pain and reduce the spread of the cancer, prolonging life.</p> <p><span>The options for mesothelioma surgery could include one or more of the following.</span><br />-- Pleurectomy<br />-- Pneumonectomy<br />-- Thoracentesis<br />-- Extrapleural Pneumonectomy</p> <h3>Pleurectomy</h3> <p>Pleurectomy, also known as 'Decortication' is a process in which the surgeon will remove a part of the infected lung and chest lining. This procedure helps in reducing the size of the cancerous tumor and also reduce the associated pain within the chest. The main purpose of pleurectomy is to relieve the throbbing pain, with life expectancy remaining the same or improving marginally.</p> <h3>Pneumonectomy</h3> <p>During a pneumonectomy, the surgeon will remove an entire affected lung and the surrounding tissue. As in a pleurectomy, this procedure too is done to relieve the associated pain, and is performed only when the cancer has spread to a great extent.</p> <h3>Thoracentesis</h3> <p>Thoracentesis is a procedure where the surgeon will drain excess fluid from and around the lungs with the help of a needle. This is done to get the fluid levels to normal, helping reduce pressure on the lungs and making breathing easier.</p> <h3>Extrapleural Pneumonectomy</h3> <p>Extrapleural pneumonectomy is a very complex procedure and will be performed by the surgeon only in extreme cases. Added to this is the fact that mesothelioma must be diagnosed early for performing this surgery. This process involves removing the entire lining surrounding the lungs, heart, and diaphragm to prevent any further spread of the cancer. This process is usually followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy to kill any remaining unseen cancer cells. Even this process is not a cure for mesothelioma that is diagnosed early, but it will add many more years to the patients life.</p> <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3> <p>When radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) is chosen as the mode of treatment for mesothelioma, the surgeon will kill the cancer cells and shrink the cancerous tumors using high-energy x-rays.</p> <p>Radiation therapy is in most cases supplementary to some other type of treatment. The problem with radiation therapy is that it cannot focus on and kill only the cancer cells; it also targets and kills perfectly normal human cells. In most cases the damage and side-effects caused by radiation therapy will outweigh the benefits.</p> <h3>Chemotherapy</h3> <p>In chemotherapy, chemicals are injected into the cancerous parts of the body. These chemicals have the capability to stop multiplication or destroy the cancer cells.</p> <p>In most cases, the chemical is injected into a vein or muscle, traveling through the entire body. Specialists treating mesothelioma could administer the chemical directly into the patients pleural or peritoneal cavity for better results.</p> <p>Chemotherapy is usually followed by undesirable side-effects. The surgeon will prescribe medication and give advise on reducing these side-effects.</p> <h3>Combination Therapy</h3> <p>Depending on the situation, the surgeon may decide on combining two or more therapies for obtaining the best results. The benefits of combination therapy will be better than that of a single therapy, but it could also be very harsh on the body, making it unsuitable for everyone. It can be used on patients who are young, healthy, and can withstand the undesirable side-effects of this treatment.</p> <h2>Latest Treatments</h2> <p>Mesothelioma is affecting many today, making it one of the most researched diseases with a multitude of clinical trials in progress. Surgeons are using the normal methods of treatment in combination with new therapies and drugs that look very promising. It is estimated that these new treatments that are currently undergoing trials will prolong life after diagnosis from a mere 12 to 18 months to approximately 5 to 10 years.</p> <p>With the pace and advancement of clinical trials at present, surgeons hope that a total cure will soon be available for the treatment of mesothelioma.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Difficulty urinating, weak urine flow and painful urination are some of the most common symptoms of early prostate cancer.</p> <h3>Did You Know?</h3> <p><span>Prostate cancer symptoms resemble those associated with benign tumors and other urological conditions. So, it is best to consult a doctor for further diagnosis.</span></p> <p>The prostate is a glandular organ found only in males, that lies just below the bladder (storage chamber of urine) and envelops the urethra (the tube that transports urine from the bladder for elimination). Prostate cancer, one of the most common type of cancer diagnosed in United States, has higher incidence in men who have crossed 65 years of age. Obesity, diet high in fatty foods, overweight and genetic susceptibility are some of the risk factors of prostate cancer.</p> <h2>Prostate Cancer Symptoms</h2> <p>As the tumor begins to form in the prostate tissues, the size of the prostate gland starts increasing. The slow enlarging of the prostate eventually starts exerting excessive pressure on the urethra. This can cause a wide range of urinating problems. In most cases, the symptoms occur when the tumor has grown significantly big and is pushing the urethra considerably. They are discussed below:</p> <h3>Urinating Often</h3> <p>The person has to visit the toilet to pee more often than usual. Sitting for even half an hour without urinating may seem difficult. Although the urine output is not high, there is urgency to urinate frequently, especially at night.</p> <h3>Painful Urination</h3> <p>Burning pain while urinating can also be a sign of early prostate cancer. Inflamed prostate associated with this type of cancer can cause pain while passing urine. The pain is usually experienced at the tip of the penis during urination.</p> <h3>Trouble Initiating and Stopping Urine</h3> <p>Facing a hard time to start and stop the urine stream can be a warning sign of early prostate cancer. The person is observed urinating in waves and finds it difficult to maintain a steady urine flow. Apart from interrupted urine flow, there may be a lack of force to the urine flow. To be precise, weak or slow urine stream is observed, which may indicate serious issues with the prostate (including cancer).</p> <h3>Urine Leakage</h3> <p>The partial blockage of urethra due to enlarged prostate can cause urinary incontinence in the form of urine leakage. The bladder is unable to empty itself completely, so the urine remaining may drain (rather dribble) unpredictably. Even after taking a trip to the toilet, small amount of urine may continue to leak randomly. The person may also accidentally leak urine while laughing or sneezing.</p> <h3>Other Urological Issues</h3> <p>Pain upon ejaculation, trouble getting and maintaining an erection are some of the other symptoms of prostate cancer. As the malignancy spreads to nearby areas, the person may experience consistent pain in the groin, pelvic and lower back region. In the later stages of cancer, the inflamed prostate damages the urethra, which may cause bleeding. So, as the cancer advances, blood in the urine or semen may be observed.</p> <h2>Diagnosis</h2> <p>Research shows that image-guided biopsy may be more effective in early diagnosis of prostate cancer as compared to other traditional tests such as digital rectal examination and PSA test. In case, presence of cancer is confirmed, other tests that include MRI and CT scan may be carried out to check how far the cancer has penetrated into other parts of the body.</p> <h2>Treatment</h2> <h3>Wait and Watch Approach</h3> <p>This approach comes into picture when the cancer is detected early and found to be non progressive. A medical check-up of the patient that involves undergoing all the necessary tests, is done on a regular basis to assess the cancer status.</p> <h3>Surgery</h3> <p>In case the cancer is observed to be progressing, surgery may be recommended. Radical Prostatectomy, which is a complete removal of all the prostate and nearby tissue that could also have been affected. In addition there is a type of surgery that is used to allow enough nerve tissue so that erections remain possible and thus not terminate the sexual life of the person involved.</p> <h3>Radiation</h3> <p>This involves bombarding an external beam of radiation on the prostate tissue or implantation of a radioactive seed in the prostate by way of a needle. These are generally outpatient surgeries.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> <i>The information provided in this article is solely for educating the reader.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>At some point, most men have to go through a prostate examination as a part of general health screening, or they are advised to get this test done due to their age or other medical factors.</p> <p>The prostate gland produces most of the fluid part of the semen. The presence of this gland is barely noticed by those who are healthy. Most men only take notice of it when some troubling symptoms start to appear, like frequent and painful urination, lower back pain, interruption in the flow of urine and retention of urine in the urethra (signaled by dribbling urine in underclothes). While most people suspect cancer when the prostate gland is mentioned, other less serious conditions also afflict the prostate like inflammation (prostatitis) and increase in size (hypertrophy).<br><br>The prostate is a small gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It weighs about 20 to 25g in a healthy adult male. The urethra passes from the bladder, through the prostate and then through the shaft of the penis. The chief function of the prostate is to secrete a fluid that provides nourishment for sperms.</p> <h3>Examination of the Prostate Gland</h3> <p>There are various ways of checking for abnormalities of the prostate. Presence of hard lump-like areas, nodules, or sunk-in regions are considered abnormal. Apart from the methods for direct examination of the prostate, a blood test for higher-than-normal amount of a particular protein produced by the gland is done to detect cancer or other conditions. Because the prostate is surrounded by organs, it is not directly accessible. It can be palpated through the wall of the rectum.</p> <h3>Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)</h3> <p>This is the most widely used procedure used for assessing the size and texture of the prostate. A doctor inserts a gloved finger (usually index finger) into the rectum to feel the prostate. The finger is lubricated to avoid pain and discomfort to the patient.<br><br>The patient is asked to remove his trousers and underclothes. To facilitate the DRE, he is then asked to orient himself in a certain position. The positions usually used for a DRE are:<br><br><em>Left Lateral Position:</em> The patient lies down on his left side with the knees drawn close to the chest.<br><br><em>Lithotomy Position:</em> The patient lies on his back, with knees raised up and drawn close to the chest.<br><br><em>Knee-chest Position:</em> The patient kneels with elbows resting on the examination table or bed.<br><br>Many times, the patient is simply asked to stand with feet apart, toes bent inwards and knees flexed slightly. Then, he is asked to bend over and rest his hands on the examination table.<br><br>When the patient is in the appropriate position, the buttocks are drawn apart to expose the anal region. The perineum (region between anus and scrotum) is examined for signs of injury or disease. The finger is inserted into the rectum. It is slowly moved over the rectal wall to feel the two lobes of the prostate, and the groove (depression) between them. Irregular lumpy areas or nodules, tenderness, uneven or sunk-in areas, hard and firm areas, inability to feel the groove between the two lobes of the prostate; all these are what doctors particularly look for in a DRE.<br><br>The posterior and lateral part of the prostate can be palpated (felt) in the examination; however, some part obviously remains out of reach. When the examination is over, the finger is removed, the patient is given some tissues to wipe off the lubricant, and asked to put on his clothes.</p> <h3>Is Prostate Examination Necessary?</h3> <p>Some people feel that a prostate exam should not be a part of the regular health checkup. This might be because they find the procedure embarrassing, painful or simply unnecessary. However, in case of prostatic cancer, early screening is vital. Men of African-American ancestry are at a higher risk of being afflicted by prostate cancer. As a man ages, the risk of cancer increases too, and it is generally recommended that men above 50 years of age should have a prostate exam as a part of the regular health checkup. <strong>DRE should be avoided if the patient is suffering from neutropenia.</strong></p> <p>There are other types of examinations and tests that are used along with DRE to confirm a suspected diagnosis or to distinguish between closely related signs of two different diseases. These tests are:<br><br><strong>Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Test:</strong> Protein-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by the prostate gland. The PSA level is usually elevated in conditions like prostate cancer and prostatitis. It is, therefore, an important parameter for knowing about pathological conditions of the prostate. However, it is not a very reliable parameter on its own, and its significance depends upon the results you get from other tests.<br><br><strong>Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS):</strong> In this procedure, a sound wave emitting device, known as a TRUS probe, is inserted into the rectum. For this, an ultrasound gel is applied to the probe which is covered in a sheath. It emits sound waves that bounce off various organs including the prostate. From the reflected sound waves, an image of the prostate is created. This procedure can detect irregularities that a DRE has missed. It also reveals the size of the prostate.<br><br><strong>Prostate Biopsy:</strong> If a patient's DRE reveals abnormalities, and if his PSA is elevated, then a biopsy (removal of tissues for further tests), is done to confirm a suspected diagnosis. The biopsy sample is taken with the assistance of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). A needle attached to the TRUS probe is guided to various points, from where samples of prostate tissues are taken.</p> <p>A prostate exam should not be shied away from, as it reveals the very early signs of prostate gland problems. It becomes especially relevant, given the high mortality rate of people with prostate cancer.</p> <p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</em></p>"

    "post_content": "<p>People often get confused between Mesothelioma and Asbestosis. However, they are two totally different conditions arising due to the same cause i.e. asbestos exposure. Mesothelioma is the deadliest type of cancer known, whereas asbestosis is a non-cancerous, chronic lung ailment, details of which are described in this article.</p> <h3>What is Asbestosis</h3> <p>Asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory lung disease caused by asbestos exposure (inhalation). In asbestosis the parenchymal tissue of the lungs gets scarred, causing dyspnea (difficulty in breathing) and in more advanced cases leads to lung cancer and mesothelioma.</p> <p>Breathing microscopic asbestos fibers over a period of time lodge these fibers firmly into the lungs, leading to lung scarring and a drastic reduction in breathing capacity.</p> <p>As with mesothelioma, the signs and symptoms of asbestosis appear years after asbestos exposure, and once detected, the condition of the patient will worsen drastically, leading to permanent disability and even death.</p> <h3>What is Asbestos</h3> <p>Asbestos is a class of minerals appearing naturally as thin separable fibers. It consists of two groups: chrysotile and amphibole. Amphibole asbestos have straight needle-like fibers and consist of actinolite, anthophylite, amosite, crocidolite, and tremolite. Chrysotile is the asbestos variety that was/is most used in commercial applications.</p> <p>Asbestos has been mined for long, with increased use since the 1800s. Due to certain known properties of asbestos such as excellent heat resistance, excellent fire resistance, excellent chemical resistance, and an excellent non-conductor of electricity, it was used widely since the 1940s right through the 80s. It was in the 80s that asbestos use in many commercial applications was banned. Asbestos was used in floor tiles, roofing, insulation material, pop ceilings, switch boards, paints, insulation for ship boilers and hot water pipes, in clutch and brake-liners of all vehicles, and in host of other applications.</p> <p>The ill-effects of asbestos inhalation were well-known from a very long time, but it was banned in almost all products in the late 80s due to a sudden increase in asbestos related diseases.</p> <h3>Who is at Maximum Risk?</h3> <p>Those at a maximum risk of asbestosis are people exposed to asbestos over long periods of time. Those working in asbestos mines are at a greater risk. Others who are at a risk of asbestosis are those living in the surroundings of asbestos mines, construction workers, shipyard workers, clutch and brake-liner workers and mechanics, and all those who have had asbestos exposure at work. Even their family and friends are at a risk.</p> <p>Today asbestos is banned in almost all products and handling of old asbestos is regulated. Even with all precautions taken, individuals even today are at a risk as while renovating their homes they may get exposed to asbestos in the flooring, roofing, and insulation of the buildings.</p> <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3> <p>The signs and symptoms of asbestosis could take in between 20 to 40 years to develop and surface. Combined with this problem, most of the symptoms of asbestosis overlap with signs and symptoms of other ailments such as asthma or bronchitis. All this makes the detection of asbestosis very difficult.</p> <p><span>Asbestosis could have one or more of the following symptoms.</span><br /><br />-- Difficulty breathing, with the condition getting worse over a period of time<br />-- Constant dry, crackling sound while breathing<br />-- Getting tired after doing very little physical work<br />-- Constant mild to severe pain in the chest<br />-- Constant cough</p> <h2>Other Complications</h2> <p>Asbestosis is usually detected when it has caused considerable damage. This damage will now not only be limited to the lungs but also spread to other organs of the body.</p> <p><span>Complications caused due to asbestosis could include one or more of the following.</span><br /><br />-- Lung cancer<br />-- Increased blood-pressure within the lungs<br />-- Heart complications<br />-- Mesothelioma</p> <h3>Lung Cancer</h3> <p>It has been observed that heavy smokers who have been detected with asbestosis are at a great risk of developing lung cancer. This happens due to the decreased capacity of the lungs combined with the harmful effects of cigarette smoke.</p> <h3>Increased Blood-pressure in Lungs</h3> <p>The scars caused by asbestos fibers lodged within the lungs will over time compress the lungs blood vessels. This in turn causes a high blood-pressure in the lung arteries known as pulmonary hypertension.</p> <h3>Heart Complications</h3> <p>The increased blood-pressure in the lungs over time could lead to the enlargement and failure of the heart's right ventricle which pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs.</p> <h3>Mesothelioma</h3> <p>Asbestosis takes approximately 20 to 40 years after initial asbestos exposure to surface. By this time the thin asbestos fibers could travel to the outer lining of the lungs (pleura) where it can cause cancer known as mesothelioma. This is the worst type of cancer known, usually leading to death within 12 to 18 months after diagnosis. Mesothelioma could affect the lining of the lungs, stomach, or heart.</p> <p>Asbestosis and mesothelioma are two totally different diseases with the same cause (asbestos exposure) and should not be confused with each other.</p> <h2>Treatment</h2> <p><span>Treatment of asbestosis could contain one or more of the following.</span><br /><br />-- Vaccination<br />-- Medication<br />-- Stopping smoking</p> <h3>Vaccination</h3> <p>In asbestosis, the condition and capacity of the lungs deteriorate to a great extent. Even a minor cold or a bout of flu could create severe complications. It is very important to make sure that any ailment (however minor) concerning the lungs should be avoided. It is for this purpose the physician may give the patient vaccines for flu and pneumonia.</p> <h3>Medication</h3> <p>Pulmonary hypertension will almost always be a part of asbestosis. This complication is dealt with medication that helps in expanding the blood vessels. Blood thinners could also be prescribed to make sure that no blood clots are caused which can block the narrowed vessels.</p> <h3>Stop Smoking if Diagnosed with Asbestosis</h3> <p>It is very crucial to quit smoking (in reference to only those who smoke) if diagnosed with asbestosis. The reduced capacity of the lungs combined with cigarette smoke make for the perfect combination and highest risk of lung cancer. Smoking will also further reduce the capacity of the lungs making it very difficult to breathe.</p> <p>Do not make something as grave as asbestosis a reason to quit smoking. Giving up smoking is a good idea (for you, more so for those around you), even if you are perfectly healthy at present.</p>"

    "post_excerpt": "Chemotherapy is an option of treatment for patients diagnosed with mesothelioma. If diagnosed, you must find out about the benefits and side-effects of chemotherapy for mesothelioma before treatment begins.",
    "post_name": "mesothelioma-chemotherapy",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Chemotherapy is an option of treatment for patients diagnosed with mesothelioma. If diagnosed, you must find out about the benefits and side-effects of chemotherapy for mesothelioma before treatment begins.</p> <h3>Mesothelioma</h3> <p>Mesothelioma is a rare type of cancer of the mesothelium. Mesothelium is the thin membrane that covers the lungs, stomach, and heart. The prime function of the mesothelium is to release a small amount of lubricating fluid which helps the organs to move freely without any friction. The membrane covering the lungs is known as pleura, membrane covering the stomach is known as peritoneum, and membrane covering the heart is known as pericardium. Over 80% of those suffering from mesothelioma are diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma.</p> <p>Asbestos exposure is the prime cause of mesothelioma. The main problem with mesothelioma is that it takes approximately 30 to 40 years after initial exposure for symptoms to show. Most of these symptoms are common with other more common ailments such as the common cold and flu. Almost always serious damage is already done by the time mesothelioma is diagnosed.</p> <h3>Treatments for Mesothelioma</h3> <p>Once mesothelioma is diagnosed the physician/surgeon will decide on the course of treatment depending on the stage at which the cancer is diagnosed, the age and general physical health of the patient. Options for mesothelioma treatment include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Since there is no permanent cure for mesothelioma, many unconventional forms of treatment are combined with these methods.</p> <h3>What is Chemotherapy?</h3> <p>Chemotherapy is a therapy which makes use of certain medicines/drugs to treat cancer. Surgery or radiation therapy remove or destroy cancer cells in a particular area. This is where chemotherapy differs vastly from these two treatments. Chemotherapy works on the entire body, and is able to destroy metastasized cancer cells that have spread to distant parts away from the primary tumor.</p> <p>There are a vast number of chemotherapy drugs currently in use, and your physician/surgeon may use a single drug (chemotherapy) or a combination of drugs (combination chemotherapy) to treat the cancer. Combination chemotherapy is preferred because drugs used in combination tend to work more effectively and the chances of the body becoming resistant to the drugs is reduced.</p> <h3>Chemotherapy for Mesothelioma</h3> <p>The surgeon will decide on what treatment option best suits a person with mesothelioma. Factors such as the stage of the cancer and the person's physical health are taken into account and the treatment is decided as per that. Surgery and radiation therapy are options besides chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can be used in combination with surgery and radiation therapy.</p> <p>Chemotherapy is usually given through a vein as a drip, or as an injection into the bloodstream. If found suitable the drugs may be put directly into the chest/abdominal cavity. Chemotherapy is not done at a stretch, but is broken down into a number of cycles. Treatment continues for a few days after which it is stopped for a few weeks so that the body can recover from the side-effects of chemotherapy. After the body has recovered, another cycle begins. The number of cycles depend on the stage at which mesothelioma is diagnosed, the type of drugs used, and the body's response to chemotherapy.</p> <h3>Chemotherapy Side-effects</h3> <p>Chemotherapy comes with a host of undesirable side-effects. Certain side-effects are common, notwithstanding the type of drugs used in treatment. Some side-effects will depend on the type of drugs used, amount of drugs used, and the number of treatment cycles.</p> <p>Side-effects of chemotherapy could include one or more of the following.<br />-- Fatigue<br />-- Exhaustion without exertion<br />-- Hair loss<br />-- Nausea<br />-- Vomiting<br />-- Anemia</p> <h3>Hair Loss during Chemotherapy</h3> <p>Almost everyone undergoing chemotherapy for mesothelioma will suffer from hair loss which could be mild to severe. Hair loss usually begins within 2 weeks of chemotherapy, getting worse as treatment continues, finally improving only after a couple of months of the treatment being stopped. This sudden hair fall could cause a lot of stress to most patients, especially women. What should be understood here is that the hair will grow back once the treatment is stopped.</p> <h3>Nausea and Vomiting during Chemotherapy</h3> <p>Vomiting and nausea are other common side-effects of chemotherapy during mesothelioma treatment. It is suggested that the patient should eat very small meals throughout the day instead of having 3 large meals. Never eat hurriedly, always chew the food thoroughly to make digestion easier. Until chemotherapy is stopped the patient must avoid eating any sort of fried foods, fatty foods, sweets, and avoid/reduce the amount of meat intake. It is best to have a lot of fresh vegetables. Ask the physician for advice on what to eat and what to avoid.</p> <h3>Find the Side effects of Chemotherapy Before Treatment Begins</h3> <p>Many patients suffering from mesothelioma are not aware of the side-effects of chemotherapy. If they go into treatment without knowing all the side-effects, it could be very difficult on them, causing unwanted stress. If diagnosed with mesothelioma, and the surgeon decides to go in for chemotherapy, find out about all the possible side-effects and what measures could be taken to reduce them.</p> <p>Once chemotherapy has begun, let your surgeon know of all the side-effects that you face, however minor. These side-effects could be minimized with further medication making life for the patient more comfortable.</p>"

    "post_name": "gallbladder-problems-symptoms",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Gallbladder problems often go undetected, as their signs or symptoms can mimic those of other digestive ailments. The following write-up provides information on the common symptoms of gallbladder problems.</p> <p>Gallbladder is a pear-shaped sac that is located beneath the liver in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The main function of the gallbladder is to store and release bile, which is the digestive enzyme that is produced by the liver. The potency of bile increases in the gallbladder as it becomes more concentrated. The secretion of bile is facilitated by hormones called cholecystokinin and secretin. Cholecystokinin, which is secreted when fat is present in the duodenum, stimulates the gallbladder to contract. This is followed by relaxation of a valve called sphincter of Oddi, which allows bile to flow towards the small intestine. Secretin is released in response to the presence of acid in the duodenum. It stimulates the secretion of water and bicarbonate, which increases the volume of bile, thereby facilitating the flow of bile to the intestine.</p> <p>Bile plays a vital role in the digestion of fat. If the secretion of bile is adversely affected due to gallbladder disease, the affected individual is likely to experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Since the symptoms of medical conditions associated with the gallbladder are often similar to those of other digestive ailments, the actual underlying problem is often misdiagnosed. Thus, it is always better to have a basic idea about some of the common signs of gallbladder problems.</p> <p><strong>Conditions that May Affect the Gallbladder</strong></p> <p>The incidence of gallbladder disease is quite high in the elderly. According to statistics, women are more likely to develop gallbladder issues. While most of these medical conditions are not life-threatening, these may cause severe discomfort. Gallbladder could malfunction due to a wide range of reasons. These include medical conditions like hypothyroidism, liver problems, and diabetes. Risk factors also include obesity, exposure to environmental toxins, excess estrogen, consumption of a fatty diet or diet low in fiber, etc. Here are some of the common conditions that could affect the gallbladder.</p> <p><div><strong>Gallbladder Sludge</strong></div>n<br>Gallbladder sludge is the precursor to gallstones. It refers to the mixture of bile, mucin, and particulate matter (calcium salts and cholesterol crystals). It may or may not produce symptoms. Symptoms may appear when sludge moves into the biliary tract and obstructs the bile ducts. The gelatinous sludge may even crystallize to form gallstones. This could cause cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder).</p> <p>Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are some of the symptoms that may be experienced. The symptoms are likely to occur after the consumption of a fatty meal. Inflammation of pancreas or the bile ducts are other complications associated with gallbladder or biliary sludge.</p> <p><div><strong>Cholelithiasis</strong></div>n<br>Formation of gallstones is one of the most common gallbladder problems. Gallstones are stone-like deposits that could develop in the gallbladder. Their size may vary. These could be as small as a grain of sand or as big as a golf ball. These deposits are either composed of calcium, bilirubin, or cholesterol. Almost 80% of the gallstones are found to be made of cholesterol. The mere presence of gallstones in the gallbladder is medically referred to as cholelithiasis. This condition may not cause symptoms (silent gallstones) in almost 90% of the affected people, and it may remain so for decades.</p> <p>Symptoms may appear when these deposits block the flow of bile. This usually occurs when the deposits are large. The term 'gallbladder attack' refers to a group of distressing symptoms that may be felt by the affected individuals. Sudden onset of spasmodic pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, burping, belching, heartburn, and nausea are some of the common symptoms of a gallbladder attack. The pain caused by this condition is referred to as biliary colic. Pain may last from a few minutes to hours.</p> <p><div><strong>Cholecystitis</strong></div>n<br>Inflammation of the gallbladder is medically referred to as cholecystitis. Apart from gallstones, tumors (that cause buildup of bile), scarring of the bile duct (blockage of bile flow), etc., can cause this condition. Obstruction of the cystic duct could also cause inflammation of the gallbladder.</p> <p>Symptoms like upper abdominal pain (right side), nausea, vomiting, bloating, etc., may be experienced by the affected individuals. In severe cases, jaundice may develop.</p> <p><div><strong>Porcelain Gallbladder</strong></div>n<br>Chronic cholecystitis (recurrent or persistent inflammation of the gallbladder) could cause scarring of the gallbladder, which in turn, may cause it to become rigid and non-functional. The term 'porcelain gallbladder' refers to the calcification of the gallbladder wall due to chronic cholecystitis. It is believed that this condition could be caused by excessive formation of gallstones.</p> <p>Calcification of the gallbladder wall causes it to become hard and brittle. Bluish discoloration of the gallbladder wall is another sign of this gallbladder problem. Abdominal pain after meals, nausea, and vomiting are some of the symptoms that may be experienced by the affected individual.</p> <p><div><strong>Acalculous Cholecystopathy</strong></div>n<br>The term 'acalculous cholecystopathy' refers to gallbladder diseases which are not associated with gallstones. Biliary dyskinesia is a motility disorder which is characterized by abnormal gallbladder emptying. This occurs when the gallbladder is unable to contract properly. Gallbladder function could also get adversely affected if the sphincter of Oddi, which is the valve through which bile flows towards the small intestine, doesn't function properly.</p> <p>People affected by this condition may experience right abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, flatulence, etc. These symptoms could be triggered by consumption of a fatty meal.</p> <p><div><strong>Choledocholithiasis</strong></div>n<br>The presence of one or more gallstones in the common bile duct (the duct into which the cystic duct releases bile) is referred to as choledocholithiasis. Such a condition may obstruct bile and the stagnant bile may cause cholangitis (inflammation of the bile duct).</p> <p>This may cause abdominal pain and other digestive problems. This condition may sometimes lead to acute pancreatitis and even liver infection.</p> <p><div><strong>Gallbladder Polyps</strong></div>n<br>Gallbladder polyps are benign growths that could develop on the inner lining of the gallbladder. These may be asymptomatic, especially during the initial stages. These are often detected incidentally during a checkup. Surgical removal of polyps is recommended only if they are big. It should be noted that polyps may increase the risk of gallbladder cancer, which refers to the development of a malignant growth due to abnormal and uncontrolled cell division.</p> <p>Fever, weight loss, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark yellow urine and pale stools are some of the symptoms of gallbladder cancer. The treatment may involve the removal of the gallbladder through surgery.</p> <p><strong>Common Symptoms</strong></p> <p>The severity of symptoms may vary, depending on the underlying condition. Here are some of the common symptoms of gallbladder diseases.</p> <p><span>\u25ba</span> Pain is usually felt in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.<br><span>\u25ba</span> Pain may radiate to the back and shoulders.<br><span>\u25ba</span> Pain may worsen on taking deep breaths.<br><span>\u25ba</span> Pain usually develops after a heavy, fatty meal, especially during nighttime.<br><span>\u25ba</span> Pain may be accompanied by heartburn, chest pain and bloating.<br><span>\u25ba</span> Flatulence, belching, indigestion and tenderness of the abdomen may be experienced.<br><span>\u25ba</span> In severe cases, the affected individual may develop nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever, chills, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), clay-colored stools, etc.</p> <p><strong>Atypical Symptoms</strong></p> <p>At times, the affected individual may experience symptoms that may appear to be unrelated to gallbladder problems. Such atypical symptoms are often overlooked and the underlying condition is left untreated until it flares up.</p> <p><span>\u25ba</span> Gallbladder problems could cause symptoms like constipation, excessive weight gain or weight loss, food cravings, loss of appetite, etc.<br><span>\u25ba</span> Those with gallbladder issues could experience referred pain below the right shoulder or between the shoulder shades. Pain may be referred to the back.</p> <p>In short, medical conditions associated with the gallbladder may cause mild to severe symptoms, depending on the underlying cause. So, if you do experience such symptoms, seek medical assistance. Treatment options may involve drug therapy or other procedures (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy or oral dissolution therapy for gallstones). In severe cases, cholecystectomy (surgical removal of gallbladder) may be recommended.</p> <p>Some of these problems can be prevented by following a low-fat diet. Having small, frequent meals would prove beneficial. Drink adequate amounts of water and reduce the intake of dairy products. It would be best to cut down on the intake of refined carbohydrates, sugars, protein-rich foods, alcohol, etc. Avoid smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol. Do follow the guidelines and lifestyle changes suggested by your doctor.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This article is for informational purposes only and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.

    "post_name": "what-is-brucellosis",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Domesticated animals are perilous when they develop brucellosis. The prevention is exacting and treatment is cumbersome. Read on for more.</p> <p>Brucellosis is an infectious disease that originates in animals and further attacks human beings. It is so named because the causative agent is a bacterium of the kind Brucella. It is usually seen to affect domestic animals like dogs, goats, cattle, and pigs. The disease is omnipresent and generally widespread in developing nations. In the 19th century, it was called Malta fever or Mediterranean fever. From the 20th century, it was referred to as undulant fever. The reason was that the fever falls and rises over some weeks in untreated patients.</p> <h3>Brucellosis in Cattle</h3> <p>Cattle fall prey to this disease due to the bacteria Brucella abortus. Presence of these bacteria can lead to abortions, arthritis, or weak progeny. Abortions occur due to two reasons - infections in the placenta and fetus or absence of anti-brucella activity in the amniotic fluid. In males, these bacteria are found in the reproductive system. The Brucella milk ring test is carried out to separate the infected animals. Those which are infected are usually killed. Veterinary doctors should vaccinate the young cattle to bring the situation under control.</p> <h3>Brucellosis in Dogs</h3> <p>Brucella canis are the bacteria that are found in dogs. They propagate due to breeding and contact with aborted fetuses. Generally, the lymphatic system and the genitals are affected. However, the kidney, eye, and intervertebral disc may also suffer. In females, abortion takes place. In males, the testicles and scrotum are inflamed. Both males and females contract fever. Blood testing is done, before the breeding season begins, to minimize the spread of this disease.</p> <h3>Spread of the Disease in Humans</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Consumption of untreated or contaminated milk and its derived products</li>n<li>Direct contact with infected goats, sheep, bison, cattle, camels, pigs, and dogs wherein the bacteria can penetrate through normal human skin</li>n<li>Direct contact with carcasses of above animals</li>n</ul>n<b></b></p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Similar to other feverish diseases, the symptoms are:n<ul>n<li>Fluctuating fever</li>n<li>Sweating with an odor similar to wet hay</li>n<li>Muscular and body pain</li>n<li>Headache and anorexia</li>n<li>Weakness and depression</li>n</ul>nThese may last for some weeks or years. In the first stage, septicemia, migratory arthralgia, and myalgia occur. Blood tests reveal anemia, leukopenia and raise of AST and ALT. In the absence of treatment, brucellosis becomes chronic or causes focalizations in joints and/or bones or spondylodiscitis of lumbar spine.</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>Detection of this disease depends on various factors like:n<ul>n<li>Blood culture in tryptose broth and bone marrow cultures - the brucellae are highly infective and the laboratory personnel must be on the alert</li>n<li>Classic Huddleston, Bengal Rose, and/or Wright reactions - ELISA or 2-mercaptoethanol assay is used for IgM antibodies</li>n<li>Osteophytosis or degradation of anterior-superior corner of lumbar vertebrae</li>n<li>Granulomatous hepatitis</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Following antibiotics have been proved to be effectiven<ul>n<li>Rifampicin</li>n<li>Tetracycline</li>n<li>Gentamicin</li>n<li>Streptomycin</li>n</ul>nThese should be prescribed for many weeks due to the incubation of bacteria in the cells. For adults, the gold standard treatment is prescribed. It includes:n<ul>n<li>Intramuscular injections of streptomycin - daily 1 g for 14 days</li>n<li>Oral dose of doxycycline - daily 100 mg twice for 45 days</li>n<li>If streptomycin is unavailable, then intramuscular injection of gentamicin 5 mg/kg - daily once for 7 days</li>n<li>Alternatively, oral dose of doxycycline and rifampin - daily twice for minimum 6 weeks</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p>There are a few ways to prevent brucellosis:n<ul>n<li>Pasteurizing all the milk (pure form or derived form like cheese) that is consumed by human beings</li>n<li>Observing cleanliness in production of raw milk products</li>n</ul></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Allergies cause a lot of discomfort and can sometimes even have serious repercussions. There are products available that can help people allergic to various things deal with their allergies. These have been discussed in the article here.</p> <p>Millions of people lose out on the great outdoors, have to avoid family and work time due to allergies. Compared to big, life-threatening diseases, allergies seem almost benign. However, the bodily reactions to allergens can be life-threatening in some people, and even if your allergies aren't life-threatening, they are certainly life-limiting. Fortunately, for allergy sufferers there are a number of good allergy control products available.</p> <h3>Testing</h3> <p>The first thing an allergist will do in the pursuit of products that are best for you is testing. There are great tests available to show what kinds of allergies are present in your system and even narrow down exactly which plants or animals are most harmful to you. Identifying the allergen makes providing relief a lot easier.</p> <h3>OTC Drugs</h3> <p>Anti-histamines and decongestants both can work to restore your sinus passages back to normal. There are non-drowsy formulas and even milder doses for people who get affected by heavy medications. Your allergist can also prescribe some medication that may be stronger or be able to target your symptoms a little better. If you aren't getting good results from over-the-counter medication, see your allergist for a more potent solution and better relief products.</p> <p>Allergy shots are also available for extreme cases.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Inflammation of the salivary glands, especially the parotid glands due to a virus is called mumps. This article provides information about the symptoms and risks associated with this condition.</p> <p>The parotid glands, which produce saliva are located at the back of each cheek between the ear and the jaw. When there is an inflammation of one or both the parotid glands, it is called parotitis, and when this inflammation is caused by a virus, it is called mumps. Mumps was common condition uptill the year 1971. It was only after the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine was licensed that the figures have dropped drastically. A single attack of mumps is said to give almost lifelong protection; so if your child has swollen salivary glands for the second time, confirm the reason for this occurrence as it could be something else!</p> <h3>How Does One Contract Mumps?</h3> <p>The condition is caused due to a RNA virus known as Rubulavirus. It belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae. Since it is caused due to a virus, it spreads from person to person. An infected person can spread it to others by coughing, sneezing, and talking. A child or a grown up who drinks or eats from a cup or a plate which has been used by an infected person may also contract it. Anyone who has not had an MMR shot or mumps in the past can also contract it.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>It is possible to know when a person is suffering from mumps, here are a few signs to watch out for. It is also important to note that in some cases the infected person may not experience any of the symptoms noted below.n<ul>n<li>Swelling of one or both the parotid glands</li>n<li>The throat feels tender and hurts while swallowing</li>n<li>Fever which lasts for two to three days</li>n<li>Sore muscles</li>n<li>An earache</li>n<li>Absence of hunger</li>n<li>Nausea</li>n<li>Adolescent boys or men sometimes experience a swelling in both the testes; however, it subsides within four days.</li>n</ul></p> <p>The aforementioned symptoms begin around 16-18 days after being exposed to the virus. In some cases, it can also start 12 to the 25 day of exposure to the virus.</p> <h3>Care Tips</h3> <p><ul>n<li>You need to take care that the person affected by this condition gets plenty of rest.</li>n<li>To ease the pain, a warm towel, a heating pad, or an ice pack can be used.</li>n<li>Give the person plenty of liquids, this will prevent dehydration.</li>n<li>Soft foods such as mashed potatoes, cooked cereals, and soups should be given.</li>n<li>Avoid food which is sour, spicy, and hard to chew.</li>n<li>Medicines which have been prescribed by the medical practitioner can be given in doses that have been advised.</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Risks</h3> <p><span>Though it is not considered a serious illness, mumps should be treated on time. If left untreated, it may cause the following problems:</span>n<ul>n<li>Swelling of the pancreas</li>n<li>An infection of the brain or spinal cord, which may ultimately lead to brain damage</li>n<li>Sterility in males</li>n<li>Partial hearing loss</li>n</ul></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>People suffering from joint swelling and pain must check out the symptoms of septic arthritis. Patients affected from rheumatoid arthritis are more susceptible to the septic type. Here are a few symptoms and treatment options for the same.</p> <p>Every joint cavity in our body contains synovial fluid, cellular matter, and some white blood cells. Inflammation of the joints due to bacterial infection is called septic arthritis or infectious arthritis, and is regarded as the most perilous type of acute arthritis. When bacteria or any other microorganisms reach a joint by passing through the blood stream, they cause septic arthritis. The hip and knee joints are most commonly affected, but of course the wrists and ankles are also involved. There are various factors that lead to the causes of this inflammatory joint disease.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>Three factors that cause septic arthritis are bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Bacteria that lead to this disease are staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, E. coli and pseudomonas spp. Viruses that contribute to this type of arthritis are hepatitis A, B and C, parvovirus B19, herpes virus, HIV (AIDS virus), HTLV1, adenovirus, coxsackie viruses, mumps and ebola. Fungi like histoplasma, coccidiomyces and blastomyces also result in septic arthritis.</p> <p>Apart from these three factors, there are a few other causes as well, which are:n<ul>n<li>Intravenous drug use</li>n<li>Record of sexually transmitted disease</li>n<li>Immunosuppressive states</li>n<li>Recent steroid injection</li>n<li>Joint disease</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p><ul>n<li>High leukocyte count</li>n<li>Sedimentation rate of more than 50 mm/hr</li>n<li>The joint that has been affected becomes warm and swollen</li>n<li>Acute pain in the affected joint, especially when you move it</li>n<li>Feverish conditions which has been true for 40 to 60% cases</li>n</ul>nThose having rheumatoid arthritis, systemic connective tissue disorders, and gout, are more prone to this disease. In 10 to 20% of patients, the disease appears as polyarticular arthritis.</p> <h2>Diagnosis</h2> <p>The synovial fluid analysis should have the following parameters:<ul><li>Gram stain</li><li>Culture</li><li>Leukocyte count</li><li>Differential and crystal examination</li></ul>When a leukocyte count of more than 50,000 along with a polymorphonuclear leukocyte predominance is seen, septic arthritis is generally inferred. The gram stain is found positive in 10 to 80% cases. Rarely, the precipitated mucin in the synovial fluid may lead to a false positive. In 90% of non-gonococcal bacterial arthritides, the synovial fluid culture is positive.</p> <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Seronegative spondyloarthropathies like psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis and arthritis pertaining to inflammatory bowel disease can show up as an acute inflamed joint.</li>n<li>20% patients having untreated Lyme disease, develop chronic persistent synovitis.</li>n<li>15% of people with infective endocarditis are affected by this disease.</li>n<li>Those having chronic joint disease are at a greater risk of septic arthritis, as the delay in diagnosis and start of treatment may cause a severe flare-up of the disease.</li>n</ul></p> <h2>Treatment</h2> <h3>Antibiotic Treatment</h3> <p>The choice of the antibiotic depends on following factors:n<ul>n<li>Age of the patient</li>n<li>Assumed source of infection</li>n<li>Infection profile of patient</li>n<li>Immunosuppression, like the record of diabetes</li>n<li>Suspected pathogenic organism</li>n</ul></p> <p>The treatment is planned as follows:n<ul>n<li>Initially, parenteral antibiotics are used, and later, cephalosporin or semi-synthetic penicillin is advised. If there is allergy to penicillin, then clindamycin or vancomycin is prescribed.</li>n<li>Third generation cephalosporins are recommended for gram-negative bacterial infection.</li>n<li>Direct inoculation of antibiotics is not essential, as it is not more useful than parenteral antibiotics.</li>n</ul>nThe duration of this treatment depends on the response of the patient and the organism isolated during final culture.</p> <h3>Draining Infected Joints</h3> <p>Needle aspiration is employed for simple cases, and for complex ones like shoulder, hip or sacroiliac joints, an open arthrotomy is the initial option. After arthrotomy, the joints must be closed, and this is done by draining them with closed suction systems. Surgical treatment is considered for patients who do not respond to antibiotics or have diseases like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, immunosuppression or systemic symptoms. The objective of a surgical method is to remove the nonviable tissue and purulent substance to finalize the need of synovectomy.</p> <h3>Prosthetic Joint Infection</h3> <p>In a large number of cases, removing the prosthetic joint is essential. This is done by excision arthroplasty or reimplantation of the joint. There is a 4 to 6 week antibiotic therapy between the removal and re-implantation of a new prosthesis. If surgical removal is not practical, then long-term suppressive antibiotics is the choice.</p> <p>Studies say that only 25 percent of patients who visit the doctor within a week can expect and hope for complete recovery. This might result in rushing through the diagnosis and treatment options, but the sooner you start the healing procedure, the better that chances of recovery.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Chickenpox has been a cause of worry for mankind for a long time now. This article will share some information about its symptoms, so that its effect can be curtailed. Have a look...</p> <p>Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). In the past, it was widespread, but today with the introduction the vaccine, fewer cases are being reported. Two doses of the varicella vaccine are recommended for children, adults, and adolescents.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>A infected person may exhibit the following signs, which differ from one individual to another.<ul><li>Fever in the range of 100\u00b0 to 102\u00b0 Fahrenheit.</li><li>Abdominal pain.</li><li>Sore throat.</li><li>Headache.</li><li>An undefinable feeling before the rash appears.</li></ul>In the beginning, the rash is small and resembles an insect bite. This develops into blisters, which are usually less than a quarter of an inch wide, and have a base which is reddish in color and filled with clear fluid. Once the blisters burst, they turn into sores. These sores finally dry and scabs are formed. These skin blisters occur in stages, starting from the abdomen, back or face. This later spreads to other conceivable places, like the scalp, mouth, nose, ears, and genitals.</p> <h3>Transmission</h3> <p>Chickenpox is contagious, that is, it can easily spread from one individual to another. A person who has chickenpox is most contagious during the first 2 - 5 days. The infected person spreads the virus by coughing, sneezing, laughing, and even talking.</p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p>The chickenpox vaccine should preferably be given to children when they are 12 to 15 months old, and the booster shot when they are 4 to 6 years old. The vaccine can also be rendered to adolescents and adults who have not had chickenpox.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Doctors administer an antiviral medication acyclovir to minimize the symptoms in adults. It is important to note that this medicine is only effective within the first 24 hours after being exposed. Children are not required to take this medicine, because apart from being expensive, it isn't of much help. Calamine lotions and oatmeal baths are used to reduce the itching.</p> <h3>Tips</h3> <p>You can care for an infected person by:<ul><li>Giving the person a bath or a wet compress every 3 to 4 hours, for the first few days, using cool or lukewarm water.</li><li>Using a dry and clean towel to pat the body dry.</li><li>Applying calamine lotion on areas that itch. (Do take care not to apply calamine lotion near the eyes)</li><li>Providing food that is cold, soft, and bland, and avoiding food that is acidic or very salty.</li><li>Consulting the doctor about medication and treatment you are unsure of.</li></ul>To discourage children from scratching and causing infections, you could use mittens or socks on their hands, apart from trimming their fingernails and keeping them clean. You should consult a doctor when:<ul><li>The fever lasts for more than 4 days.</li><li>The temperature rises above 102 \u00b0Fahrenheit</li><li>The blister becomes warm, swollen, sore or has pus.</li><li>The person has a problem looking at bright light.</li><li>There is a persistent cold and breathing issues.</li><li>The person suffers from a stiff neck.</li><li>Faces difficulty walking.</li><li>The person is drowsy and finds staying awake a task.</li><li>The person has an intense headache.</li></ul>Chickenpox can be treated easily if proper care is taken. Keep these symptoms in mind, so that you can spot it in its early stage itself.</p> <p>Disclaimer: <em>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be replaced for the advice of a medical professional.</em></p>"

    "post_title": "Psoriatic Arthritis - Symptoms and Treatment",
    "post_excerpt": "",
    "post_name": "psoriatic-arthritis",
    "post_content": "<p>Psoriatic arthritis, also known as arthritis psoriatica, arthropathic psoriasis, or psoriatic arthropathy, affects both the skin and joints. The forthcoming passages elucidate on the symptoms and treatment of this medical condition.</p> <p>Arthritis psoriatica is a condition wherein an individual is afflicted with both psoriasis as well as arthritis. Psoriasis is characterized by silvery patches on the skin that are raised and scaly. Arthritis, on the other hand, is a condition in which the joints get inflamed and swollen, and the person suffers from excruciating pain.</p> <p>Although initially much misunderstood, scientists now agree that psoriatic arthritis belongs to the category of autoimmune diseases. An autoimmune disease is a condition in which the antibodies and cells, that form a part of the immune system, attack its own tissues. Although it is rare, but sometimes there are cases where people exhibit arthritis psoriatica symptoms without showing any signs of psoriasis. However, in general, the more severely the symptoms of the skin condition are manifested, the higher are the chances that an individual will have arthritis psoriatica. According to estimations, about 8 percent of the people who get psoriasis also develop arthritis. </p> <p>According to some estimations, about 2.5 percent or around 1 million adults of the white population in the United States are afflicted by arthropathic psoriasis, and it affects about 5 to 8 percent of all the individuals who have psoriasis. This condition is less prevalent amongst darker-skinned people, such as Native Americans and African Americans. Also, about half the incidences of rheumatoid arthritis include arthropathic psoriasis as well. Although psoriasis can manifest itself at any age, it usually occurs between the age of 35 to 55 years. Both women and men are equally susceptible to it.</p> <p><b>Symptoms Observed</b><ul><li>Primarily, arthritis affects the small joints of the limbs that are in the fingers and toes. The nails of the fingers and toes are also usually affected in about 80 percent of the people with this condition. Small pits or holes appear on the nails.</li><li>Another distinctive characteristic is that, unlike rheumatoid arthritis, it does not occur symmetrically, which means that it does not manifest itself evenly on the joints of both sides of the body.</li><li>This disorder can also be manifested as arthritis mutilans, which is a particularly ravaging and deforming type of arthritis.</li><li>Apart from the joints, arthritis also affects the tendons, ligaments, and fascia, and it has a tendency of being more severe when an individual has pustular psoriasis. Often, it manifests itself on the skin first followed by the development of arthritis.</li><li>The inflammation manifests in the tissues and joints of the hands and feet by causing dactylitis, wherein the digits become like sausages. In those who get arthritis mutilans, it may seem that the joints are dissolved, and it results in an excessive growth of skin overlying them.</li><li>In 5 percent of the cases with psoriatic arthropathy, the upper portion of the cervical spine gets affected, which is a condition more commonly seen in men. Sometimes, this joint disorder also affects the eyes causing an inflammation in the area.</li></ul><b>Treatment Options</b></p> <p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen and aspirin are usually recommended when treating mild forms of psoriatic arthropathy. These help in controlling swelling, pain, and stiffness in the morning. However, NSAIDs usually irritate the lining of the stomach and intestine, and their usage over a long period of time can cause bleeding and ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the other side effects of NSAIDs which may occur are: kidney damage, retention of fluid in the body, and even heart failure. Plus, generally, NSAIDs do not have a palliative effect on psoriasis. However, these medications may be helpful for those who want to cope with the problem of stiffness and pain. In any case, it is highly advisable to consult your physician before taking any drugs, including aspirin, to relieve yourself from the pain of arthritis. </p> <p><b>Self-management</b></p> <p>Those who are affected by arthropathic psoriasis can do a lot for themselves in order to manage this painful and debilitating condition: </p> <h3>Taking Care of Your Skin</h3> <p>A daily bath is helpful for removing the scaly skin of psoriasis. However, care must be taken to avoid harsh soaps and hot water. After the bath or shower, pat your body dry with a soft towel, and apply a moisturizing lotion or cream, recommended by a physician, while the skin is still moist. Avoid using lotions or creams that contain alcohol.</p> <h3>Exposing Skin to Moderate Amounts of Sunlight</h3> <p>Since sunlight inhibits the growth of cells, it is recommended to expose the skin to moderate amounts of it. However, care must be taken to not expose the skin for longer than around twenty minutes at a time. Overexposure can lead to sunburn, which can actually exacerbate the psoriatic skin.</p> <h3>Eating a Nutritious Diet</h3> <p>Although no particular nutrient or food has been found that prevents or controls arthritis, many are considered to be quite promising. For instance, antioxidants like vitamins A, C, and E are thought to be helpful in preventing cell damage, which may be a contributory factor for arthritis. It has been shown that a diet rich in vegetables and olive oil is helpful in alleviating the symptoms of psoriatic arthropathy. Fresh vegetables are rich in phytochemicals and antioxidants, which are considered to be very healthy. Olive oil contains a high amount of vitamin E. Also, consuming foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, found in cold water fish, like salmon, herring, and mackerel, is helpful in reducing the inflammation of joints.</p> <h3>Avoiding Certain Suspect Foods</h3> <p>It is generally thought that certain foods, like red meat, citrus fruits, and vegetables and fruits that belong to the nightshade family, such as tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, and eggplant, exacerbate arthritis. Although there is no scientific proof that links these foods with inflammation or joint pain, it is better to avoid certain foods that can aggravate the condition.</p> <h3>Controlling Weight</h3> <p>Apart from taking care of the food habits, it is particularly important to control weight in conditions like psoriatic arthritis in order to put less strain on the joints. This can help in reducing pain and increasing mobility and energy.</p> <h3>Exercising Regularly</h3> <p>Several studies have shown the beneficial effects of exercise, not only for healthy people, but also for those who suffer from arthritis psoriatica. It can help in reducing many of the enfeebling effects, like fatigue and pain of the disease. A well-designed exercise program can increase the flexibility of joints, reduce stiffness in the morning, and increase mobility. It also improves the mood and is good for controlling weight.</p> <p>Please bear in mind that it is important to consult your doctor as well as listen to your own body when incorporating exercises. You should feel more energized and not worse after a workout session. Start exercising gradually, and listen to warning signs like pain. Never force your body to do anything that it is not ready for or simply cannot do. Take care!</p> <p><i>Disclaimer: This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_title": "Psoriasis: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment",
    "post_excerpt": "",
    "post_name": "psoriasis-symptoms-causes-treatment",
    "post_content": "<p>Psoriasis is a skin disorder that causes emotional stress, discomfort, and pain. Here is an account of the symptoms of the disease and its treatment.</p> <p>The word for 'itch' in Greek is where the term 'psoriasis' has been derived from. However, psoriasis cannot simply be scratched away like some minor itch. It is a chronic disorder of the skin, characterized by inflammation and scaling. The scaly skin occurs because of an overproduction of the cells of the skin on the outer layer. </p> <p>About 2-2.6 percent of the population in the US is afflicted with psoriasis, which means a figure like 5.8-7 million people. And, there are about 150,000 to 250,000 new cases that occur every year. It can occur in any age group, but the general age of the onset of the disease is around 28 years. And although both men and women get it, it is slightly more preponderant among women. </p> <p>Normally, the skin cells in the outer layer regenerate every 28 days or thereabouts. However, in people with psoriasis, this process is accelerated, with skin regenerating every two or four days. Instead of the skin simply shedding, as it does with normal skin, the extra skin cells accumulate on the skin's surface, in patches of thick, silvery, scaly layers, also called plaques. Along with the accelerated growth of the skin cells is also an increase in the blood vessels in the affected areas, which causes the redness. </p> <p>The patches or plaques usually are extremely itchy, or the person afflicted with this condition feels a burning sensation on those areas. The skin around the joints sometimes cracks. Psoriasis usually occurs on the scalp, face, elbows, lower back, knees, and even in the palms and soles. It can also have an effect on the nails of the fingers and toes, as well as the soft tissues of the body, like inside the mouth. Psoriasis also induces inflammation of the joints in 10 percent of the cases, which results in the characteristic symptoms of arthritis, hence this condition is known as psoriatic arthritis.</p> <p>Although it is not fully understood yet what causes psoriasis, research indicates that it could be due to a dysfunction of the immune system. The immune system produces a kind of white blood cell, known as a T cell, which normally protects the body against disease and infection. It is now thought that this skin disorder is triggered off by the immune system producing excessive T cells in the skin. The T cells are what induce the production of excessive skin cells and inflammation in people with psoriasis. This is what causes the silvery flaking of the skin.</p> <p>It is also thought that genetic factors could be involved; hence scientists are studying families wherein many members are affected by the disease, in order to identify the gene associated with the condition. It is theorized that some specific trigger, like an injury on the skin, emotional stress, some types of infections (like streptococcal infections), or a reaction to a prescribed drug could trigger off psoriasis in those who are genetically susceptible. The disease, like other autoimmune disorders, has periods of flare-ups and remissions. Exactly what triggers off these are not well understood either. Although the condition may seem contagious when seen, it is not at all. You cannot get psoriasis by coming in contact with somebody afflicted with it. </p> <p>The treatment of psoriasis includes drugs that inhibit the production of cells of the skin, either as a stand-alone therapy, or combined with light therapy, climatotherapy, and stress reduction therapy. Additional treatments include moisturizers, sunlight, and salicylic acid as an agent for removing scales. These therapies are usually used for people who have less than 20 percent of their skin affected by the disease, unless the condition is socially, economically, or physically disabling.</p> <p>The treatments for the more advanced form of the disease are: psoralen plus UV-A light, or PUVA, UV-A light, acitretin, retinoids, methotrexate (especially for those who have psoriatic arthritis), infliximab, cyclosporine, alefacept, and etanercept.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Joint pain relief in arthritis has a substantial impact on the daily activities of an individual. It also helps in improving the overall quality of his life. What is the role of pain relief medication in arthritis management? Read on to find out.</p> <p><div class=ux><h6>Pain and Arthritis</h6> Bones of a joint are covered with cartilage. It provides a cushion to the bones due to which the joint can move without pain. Arthritis causes cartilage damage and joint inflammation, leading to pain.</div><br>Arthritis is an illness that causes swelling, stiffness and pain in the joints of our body. Inflammation in the joint or the surrounding area leads to pain. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis affecting one or more joints of the body. Arthritis can affect the muscles and other organs too.</p> <p>Whatever the cause or the target organ, pain is the most common symptom of arthritis. Pain is also the primary symptom of many other illnesses and hence pain relief is the basic and one of the most essential parts of treatment. Pain is the body's way of telling you that something is wrong. A chemical signal is generated in the affected area and is sent to the brain. The brain recognizes it as pain.</p> <p>Pain management, also known as algiatry is a branch of medicine that deals with ways to relieve pain and improve the patients' quality of life. It employs techniques ranging from administration of medicines to relaxation techniques and psychotherapy. Here we discuss arthritis management through pain relief medication which primarily includes the use of:<ul><li>Analgesics</li><li>NSAIDs</li><li>COX-2 inhibitors</li></ul>Arthritis pain can be acute or chronic, and most forms of arthritis reach a chronic form in the course of the disease. The pain affects overall health, limits body movement and can be very distressing. Many times, pain relief becomes the main concern for the patient rather than disease control.</p> <p>Pain management plays an important role in breaking the vicious cycle of pain, stress and depression. Pain relief helps increase the mobility and bone strength by reducing discomfort in the joints. However, all forms of pain must be treated under strict medical supervision. Pain killers broadly prescribed for chronic pain relief are plain analgesics or NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). In severe cases, steroids are administered under specialty physician care which provide temporary relief from arthritis symptoms.</p> <p>Although analgesics help in pain relief, it is important to note that they do not control the disease. Painkillers, as the name suggests, provide pain relief and reduce inflammation. Some also help alleviate symptoms like fever and body ache. Thus, the selection of an ideal painkiller varies from person to person and also depends on the degree of joint inflammation.</p> <p>In the absence of swelling, and if <i>pain</i> is the only presenting symptom, an analgesic like tramadol or a paracetamol can be safely used. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, indomethacin which come under different brand names worldwide, relieve pain by reducing inflammation. COX-2 inhibitors can be prescribed for individuals with arthritis. They are less likely to have gastrointestinal side effects that NSAIDs might have.</p> <p>Analgesics have some common side effects like hyperacidity, abdominal pain, stomach ulcers and bleeding tendencies. In some cases, there can be swelling in the feet, hypertension and allergic rashes. It is important to educate the patients about arthritis care and proper counseling about the use of medicines is necessary. This helps strike a balance between the effects and side effects of the medicines being used. </p> <p>Heat and cold therapy, massage (under expert guidance), relaxation and moderate exercise are effective ways of pain management in arthritis. Correct diagnosis and treatment are more important than symptomatic relief. Additional treatment comprising medicines, nutritional supplements and lifestyle changes is advisable for controlling the symptoms of arthritis and ensuring overall health of the individual.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Liver function tests primarily measure enzymes, albumin and bilirubin. Some other tests also assist to estimate it. Have a look...</p> <p>Liver function tests are done on a patient's serum or plasma sample, procured by phlebotomy, by a medical technologist. This clinical biochemistry laboratory blood analysis furnishes crucial data regarding the condition of the patient's liver. A hepatic function panel is a blood test wherein low or high levels may point to liver diseases or damage. This panel measures the blood levels of protein albumin, bilirubin and other enzymes.</p> <h3>Functions of the Liver</h3> <p><ul>n<li>generating nearly 80% cholesterol</li>n<li>maintaining correct quantity of glucose</li>n<li>producing urea</li>n<li>transforming glucose to glycogen</li>n<li>producing some amino acids that are the building blocks of proteins</li>n<li>producing substances that break down fats</li>n<li>filtering alcohol from the blood</li>n<li>storing vitamins and minerals</li>n</ul></p> <p>When these functions are affected by some liver problems, the following common symptoms may be seen:n<ul>n<li>jaundice</li>n<li>liver enlargement</li>n<li>ascites</li>n<li>cholestasis</li>n<li>portal hypertension</li>n<li>liver encephalopathy</li>n<li>liver failure</li>n</ul>nHere's a list of the tests that study the function of the liver.</p> <h3>Albumin Measurement</h3> <p>Albumin is the major constituent of the total protein in the liver. The remnant is called globulin. Albumin must be present as 3.9 to 5.0 g/dL. In chronic diseases like \"cirrhosis\" or \"nephrotic syndrome\" the level is decreased. Poor nutrition or protein catabolism may cause \"hypoalbuminemia\".</p> <h3>Aspartate Transaminase : AST</h3> <p>This is also called \"serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase\" or \"aspartate aminotransferase\". This enzyme is related to liver parenchymal cells. It's level must be 10 to 34 IU/L. This level is raised if there is acute damage to it.</p> <h3>Alanine Transaminase : ALT</h3> <p>This is also called \"serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase\" or \"alanine aminotransferase\". This enzyme is present in liver cells (hepatocytes). It's level must be 8 to 37 IU/L. This level rises in case of acute damage like \"viral hepatitis\" or \"paracetamol overdose\".</p> <p>The ratio of AST to ALT is used to differentiate between the reasons of liver damage.</p> <h3>Alkaline Phosphatase : ALP</h3> <p>This is an enzyme that is present in the cells lining the biliary ducts of the liver. If the range is 44 to 147 IU/L, it is normal. This level rises in case of infiltrative diseases of the liver, intrahepatic cholestasis or large bile duct obstruction.</p> <h3>Gamma-glutamyl Transpeptidase : GGT</h3> <p>This is a more sensitive marker for cholestatic damage than ALP and is very specific to the liver. The standard range is 0 to 51 IU/L. Even very petty and sub-clinical levels of liver dysfunction can cause a rise in this range. Both acute and chronic alcohol toxicity raise GGT. The reason of an isolated elevation in ALP can be detected by GGT.</p> <h3>Total Bilirubin : TBIL</h3> <p>An increase in the total bilirubin can lead to jaundice.n<ul>n<li>Hepatic problems are caused due to deficiencies in bilirubin metabolism due to \"cirrhosis\" or \"viral hepatitis\".</li>n<li>Prehepatic problems are caused due to \"hemolytic anemias\" or \"internal hemorrhage\". There is an increased bilirubin production.</li>n<li>Posthepatic problems are caused due to obstruction of the bile ducts. There is a deficiency in bilirubin excretion.</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Direct Bilirubin</h3> <p><ul>n<li>When direct bilirubin is normal, then the unconjugated bilirubin may be problematic: viral hepatitis, cirrhosis or hemolysis may be present</li>n<li>When direct bilirubin is elevated, then the excretion of bilirubin may be problematic: cancer or bile duct obstruction by gallstones may be present</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Prothrombin Time Test: PTT</h3> <p>Liver cell damage and bile flow obstruction both, affect proper blood clotting. The time taken by the blood to clot is measured by this test.</p> <h3>Alpha-fetoprotein Test</h3> <p>The fetal liver and testes generate this protein. It is a symptom of hepatitis or cancer.</p> <h3>Mitochondrial Antibodies Test</h3> <p>If such antibodies are present, they prove the existence of chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or other autoimmune disorders.</p> <p><b>Other Tests</b><ul><li>Increased level of Lactate dehydrogenase possibly means liver damage</li><li>Ability to produce glucose is the final function that is lost during exploding liver failure</li><li>5' nucleotidase is a substitute for GGT to confirm if an elevated ALP has a biliary or extra-biliary origin</li><li>the International normalized ratio if increased indicates that the synthesis of vitamin-K dependent coagulation factors has been affected and the blood will take more time to clot. This is vital if the patient is to be operated.</li></ul></p> <p>These are the various tests which help determine the condition of the liver. As it is one of the most important organs in the human body, keeping it fit and fine is vital to maintain good health.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer:</b><i> The information provided in this article is solely for educating the reader.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is an ailment, in which, blood clotting or coagulation takes place in our deep vein systems. Let us explore more about the symptoms and treatment for this disease.</p> <p>Thrombus means a clot. When blood clots occur in deep vein systems they result in the reverse flow of the blood to the heart and to the lungs eventually.</p> <p>In medical parlance, this condition of reverse flow is known as pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is known as embolus and the process of blood traveling back to the lungs through heart is known as embolism. The seriousness can be understood by the fact that almost 30% of DVT leads to pulmonary embolism. A survey has found out that about 60,000 people in the US die of PE annually. More often than not, the death due to PE is misunderstood to be caused by heart attacks.</p> <p>Similar to DVT, the superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in superficial system of veins leading to the formation of swelling, pain, and redness on the skin surface of the area. Like DVT, it is not so serious a problem. Every part of the body is prone to be affected by Deep vein thrombosis, however, the thighs, legs, and pelvis are affected more frequently.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>Deep vein thrombosis is caused by several factors including injury to the veins, decreased blood flow in the veins, and the tendency of the blood to clot. Hence, people affected by paralysis, with a cast on the leg for healing a fractured bone, confined to bed for longer duration for medical or surgical reasons, and sitting crossed legs for longer duration are at a higher risk of developing this disease.</p> <p>The tendency of the blood to clot is increased because of certain conditions. While some conditions are developed in one's life, some others are inherited by birth. Use of birth control pills, the state of pregnancy, the decease cancer, and ulcerative colitis and some unusual blood conditions are examples of acquired conditions. Deficiencies in blood components, on the other hand, are owned by birth.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Tenderness and pain in the legs, swelling, increased warmth, and redness of the skin, are some of the common symptoms. The malaise can be examined with the help of x-rays, Doppler scans, plethysmography, and blood tests. The causes for increased clotting, known as hypercoagulability can be understood by the means of blood tests.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>The most crucial part of the treatment involves remedies to normalize blood clotting. This helps prevent the occurrence of PE in DVT affected person. Heparin is the most common medication that is administered for this purpose. The main function of heparin is to stop blood clotting. Normally, it is administered through veins, and for this reason, the patient needs to be hospitalized. The treatment increases the anticoagulation property of the blood.</p> <p>Along with heparin, an oral medication called warfarin is used. However, warfarin is slow in its effect. Hence, heparin is continued along with warfarin for at least 24 hours. Warfarin should be continued for at least 6 months. The function of warfarin is to increase the time taken for blood clotting, known as prothrombin time (PT). The ability of the blood to clot properly is measured by the means of a system called International Normalized ratio (INR). Warfarin is adjusted in such a way that INR is between 2 and 3. People should understand the seriousness of the ailment, and take all the possible preventive measures to avoid it.</p>"

The affected children experience pain, stiffness, and swelling in one or more joints. This trio is called inflammation. This inflammation is present for more than six weeks. The prevalent form of this type is called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Almost 50,000 children in the United States are suffering from this disease.<br><br><b>Types</b>n<ol>n<li>Polyarticular JRA: It affects more girls than boys. The small joints of the hand and the weight-bearing joints are affected. There is swelling or pain in minimum 5 joints.</li>n<li>Pauciarticular JRA: The knee and wrist joints are generally affected. Inflammation of maximum four joints is observed. Additionally, the iris may be inflamed with or without active joint symptoms.</li>n<li>Systemic JRA: There is initial fever that increases in the evening and abruptly comes back to normal. During fever, the child may develop a rash. This rash may all of a sudden disappear and reappear. The spleen and lymph nodes increase in size. Finally, many joints of the body are inflamed.</li>n</ol>n<b>Symptoms</b>n<ul>n<li>Limping or a sore wrist, knee, or finger</li>n<li>Joints may swell and appear enlarged</li>n<li>Stiffness in the neck, hips, and other joints</li>n<li>Appearance and disappearance of rashes</li>n<li>High fevers that rise during the evening and suddenly disappear</li>n</ul>n<b>Causes</b><br><br>This is an autoimmune disease. The white blood cells in the body cannot differentiate between the body's own healthy cells and harmful invaders, like viruses and bacteria. The immune system, instead of attacking the invaders, releases chemicals that may damage healthy tissues. This causes inflammation and pain.<br><br><b>Diagnosis</b><br><br>The doctor demands a detailed medical history and conducts a thorough physical examination. X-rays and blood tests are done to exclude other conditions that have similar symptoms. Other tests are as follows:n<ul>n<li>Complete blood count to evaluate basic cellular components of blood, like red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets</li>n<li>Blood culture to determine the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream</li>n<li>Bone marrow examination to test blood in the bone marrow for deciding about leukemia</li>n<li>Test to check the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which increases with inflammation</li>n<li>Test to check the rheumatoid factor, which is an antibody produced in the blood of children with some type of JRA</li>n<li>Antinuclear antibody is used to detect autoimmunity and the possibility of eye disease with JRA</li>n<li>Bone scan to determine alterations in bone and joints to analyze the reasons of unexplained bone and joint pain</li>n</ul>n<b>Treatment</b><br><br>The primary care physician, rheumatologist, and the physical therapist collaborate and design a combination of medication, physical therapy, and exercise.n<ol>n<li><b>Medication</b><br><br>Non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like <i>ibuprofen</i> (Advil, Motrin, or Nuprin), <i>aspirin, naproxen</i> or <i>naproxen sodium</i> (Naprosyn or Aleve) limits the release of harmful chemicals from white blood cells, and thereby, decreases inflammation and pain. If NSAIDs are not effective, the doctor may recommend other new medications. Sometimes, Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), like <i>methotrexate</i> are used to slow the progression of JRA. However, these require weeks or months to relieve the symptoms. Those having severe JRA are treated with Corticosteroids, like <i>prednisone</i> to control severe symptoms, like inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart. This medication is given through the mouth or directly into the vein.</li>n<li><b>Physical Therapy</b><br><br>Certain range-of-motion exercises are recommended to regain flexibility in stiff and sore joints. Other exercises enable to build strength and endurance.</li>n<li><b>Regular Exercise</b><br><br>In the presence of pain, children desire to lie down still. However, it is vital to follow a regular exercise program. Strong and healthy muscles support and protect joints. Walking, swimming, and bicycling (outdoor or indoor stationary) must be executed. Before exercise, a warm-up is necessary. A balanced diet involving a lot of calcium promotes bone health.</li>n</ol>n<b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Dengue fever is spread over most tropical areas of the world. It is a type of arthropod-borne virus that is carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.</p> <p>The <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito spreads the virus to a human being through its bite. Once the human has been bitten, the virus travels through the glands. When it reaches there, it multiplies and can enter the blood stream. Fortunately, dengue fever is not a contagious disease and cannot be passed from one person to another.</p> <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> <br>The fever usually starts with a sudden, high body temperature that ranges from 104-105\u00b0F. In the earlier phases of the infection, a flat, red rash may appear over most parts of the body. In the later stages of this disease, a second rash that resembles measles may appear. People who have been infected by this virus may have increased sensitivity in their skin. Apart from these, the other symptoms are:</p> <p><ul>n<li>A headache</li>n<li>Pain in the joints</li>n<li>Pain in the muscles</li>n<li>Swelling in the lymph nodes</li>n<li>Nausea</li>n<li>Loss of appetite</li>n</ul></p> <p>Serious cases of this dreadful fever are the dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). A person who has had dengue fever is protected by antibodies, which prevent it from occurring again for about a year. Though it is important to mention that severe cases are related to patients who have already had the virus. This is because the immune system recognizes the virus and overreacts.</p> <p><strong>Places Where Dengue Fever is Common</strong><br>Dengue fever is common in Africa, China, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, South and Central America, the Caribbean islands, Australia, and the South and Central Pacific. This disease usually occurs during or shortly after the rainy season.</p> <p><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br>This dreadful fever can be confirmed by a blood test. There are 2 testing methods that are used to detect if an individual has contracted this disease. In the first method, the virus is detected by a culture, while in the other test, it is detected by the anti-dengue bodies present in the blood.</p> <p><strong>Treatment</strong><br>Treatment focuses on medicines which are used to lower fever and reduce body pain. Fluids and bed rest are two important components of getting better. In extreme cases, blood transfusion is implemented. For patients that suffer from dengue shock syndrome (DSS), oxygen has to be provided. Almost all the patients have a complete recovery from this ailment.</p> <p><strong>Care Tips</strong><br>Since there is no vaccination to prevent dengue fever, you need to take care of yourself while traveling to the destinations where dengue is prevalent. You can do this by taking the following measures:</p> <p><ul>n<li>Using mosquito repellents.</li>n<li>Wearing long sleeve shirts and pants tucked into socks while outdoors.</li>n<li>Avoiding going into areas that are very crowded.</li>n<li>Sleeping with bed nets on, if the sleeping area is not screened or air-conditioned.</li>n<li>Keeping the area that surrounds your living quarters clean.</li>n<li>Making sure there is no stagnant water nearby.</li>n</ul></p>"

It is a normal physiological part of the aging process. Almost every person suffers from this type of arthritis in a milder or severe form depending upon the precipitating factors. Basically, osteoarthritis means the loss of cartilage between the bones of the affected joints.</p> <p>Obesity, overuse of the joints, age, genetics, gender (women are more likely to develop arthritis), trauma are considered to be some of the general risk factors. Common sites to be affected are knee, hip, spine and small joints of the hands. Pain and stiffness that increases with activity are the main symptoms of osteoarthritis. Swelling and joint instability may also be a symptom in some cases. </p> <p>The changes in the articular cartilage being irreversible, osteoarthritis can only be controlled and further thinning of cartilage can be arrested. In some cases pain-free condition can be achieved by combination of treatments. </p> <h2>Treatment of Osteoarthritis</h2> <h3>Arthritis Medications</h3> <p>Arthritis medications need to be individualized for every person. Analgesics, NSAID's, and COX-2 inhibitors are the painkillers used for joint pain relief to ensure mobility in the aching joints. Calcium and mineral supplements can be used to reduce osteoporosis. Some nutritional supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are used to minimize cartilage destruction.</p> <h3>Local Therapy</h3> <p>Topical creams and liniments can be used for pain relief. They provide temporary relief as they act superficially by relieving the pain in the muscle. Heat therapy is used for muscle relaxation and relieves the aching joints. Heat application is contra-indicated if the joints are swollen. Cold application helps to reduce the pain in such joints.</p> <h3>Intra-articular Treatments</h3> <p>Intra-articular corticosteroids can be administered in severe cases of joint pain and inflammation, but long-term and repetitive use should not be encouraged.</p> <h3>Physiotherapy and Exercises</h3> <p>Physiotherapy helps in reducing pain, stiffness and improves muscle strength and mobility of joints. Muscle strengthening exercises need to be done stringently, to support the affected joint. Excessive stress on the joints should be avoided while exercising, as it might aggravate further degeneration of the cartilage.</p> <h3>Weight Loss</h3> <p>Weight loss is the most effective way to treat this condition. Overweight individuals tend to put a lot of pressure on the knee, back and hip joints; this further accelerates the degeneration of the cartilage. Taking off the extra kilos can significantly arrest the cartilage thinning process.</p> <h3>Living with Osteoarthritis</h3> <p>Patient education is a very important aspect of arthritis management. The patient needs to be educated about the dos and don'ts in daily activities. Squatting, kneeling, prolonged standing, sitting cross-legged, lifting heavy weights should be avoided. Regular Exercises, weight maintenance and medications need to be strictly followed. Different types of braces and aids for the knees and spine can be used for supporting the affected joints.</p> <h3>Surgical Management</h3> <p>Advanced osteoarthritis needs surgical treatment like arthroscopy, osteotomy, or a total joint replacement surgery.</p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p>Prevention is the best cure and it should start in early adulthood. Though we can't stop aging, it's important to stop premature and disabling aging. Moderate muscle strengthening exercises should be done regularly. Healthy weight should be maintained with the help of exercises, and it's necessary to adopt a balanced diet. A healthy diet would help keep the excess weight off our joints thus reducing undue stress on them. Sports injury and other minor injuries should be prevented.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Yellow fever is also known as yellow jack, or sometimes the American Plague. The word 'yellow' is used for the jaundice that affects some patients. Here's more...</p> <p>Yellow fever, also known as yellow jack, hit Philadelphia in 1793, causing a lot of pain and turmoil. Unaware of the relationship between mosquitoes and the progress of the disease, the medical community of Philadelphia was dumbfounded. Ultimately, it was decided that the population should abandon the city. The cold weather was finally responsible for the disappearance of the disease. Again, in 1802, during the Haitian Revolution, this deadly disease attacked the French soldiers. More than half of the soldiers died. Research soon began, which revealed an understanding of the way the disease was spread to humans. In the early 20th century, a vaccine was developed and other preventive measures were started.</p> <h3>Definition and Cause</h3> <p>Yellow fever is a viral infection, whose root cause is an infected mosquito. This disease, as revealed earlier, has been the reason behind large epidemics in Africa and the Americas, as recognized from historic texts that date back 400 years.</p> <h3>Stages</h3> <p>In the early stage, the infected individual experiences a headache, fever, vomiting, loss of appetite, and jaundice. In about 3 to 4 days, he might experience a brief recovery. The next stage is the remission period, where the fever and symptoms disappear. Most infected individuals will experience recovery at this stage, while the others who are not that fortunate will move into the next stage within 24 hours. The last stage is the intoxication period, in which a multi-organ dysfunction takes place. This period includes brain dysfunction like delirium, seizures, coma, shock, and death, apart from liver and kidney failure, and bleeding disorders/hemorrhage.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Fever</li>n<li>Headache</li>n<li>Pain in the muscles</li>n<li>Jaundice</li>n<li>Bleeding, which may progress to hemorrhage</li>n<li>Red eyes, face and tongue</li>n<li>Brain dysfunction</li>n<li>Decreased urination</li>n<li>Delirium</li>n<li>Seizures</li>n<li>Coma</li>n<li>Vomiting blood</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>In the early stages, yellow fever can be confused with diseases like malaria, typhoid, rickettsial disease, hemorrhagic viral fevers, arboviral infections, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis, and poisoning. An individual has to go through a laboratory analysis in order to confirm the presence of the disease. Several other tests are also used to identify the virus. All the tests that are used require laboratory staff that are trained and are able to use specialized equipment and material.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>No special treatment is followed for yellow fever. Oral rehydration salts and paracetamol can be used to correct dehydration and fever. If there is a superimposed bacterial infection, it is treated with an antibiotic.</p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p>The most important measure for prevention is vaccination. In areas where no vaccination is available, it is important to be cautious. If you are venturing into an area where yellow fever is common, wear clothes that cover your entire body, use mosquito repellents, and sleep under bed nets.</p> <h3>Affected Regions</h3> <p>The virus is present in some tropical areas of Africa and the Americas. In Africa, thirty-three countries, which have a combined population of 500+ million, are at risk. In a year, a large number of cases are reported. Despite the fact that no cases have been reported from Asia, this area is also at risk because of the presence of the appropriate monkeys and mosquitoes.</p> <h3>When to seek medical attention</h3> <p>You are required to seek medical help 10 - 14 days before you enter an endemic area. This is done to check if you need the vaccination or not. Inform your health care provider if you or your family members suffer from a headache, fever, muscle ache, vomiting or jaundice, especially if you have traveled to an area in which the fever is said to occur.</p> <p><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be replaced for the advice of a medical professional.</i></span></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Infection by Staphylococcus can cause a variety of different conditions. It is a contagious infection, that spreads easily. In this article, we give you an overview about Staph infection, its symptoms, and treatment.</p> <p>Staph infection is caused by a group of bacteria known as the staph bacteria. Infection by this group of bacteria can result in infection of various tissues of the body, and can have varied results, from illnesses that are mild and treatable, to diseases that are serious and could be fatal. There are over 30 different types of Staphylococci bacteria that can cause an infection in human beings.</p> <p>The most common of these bacteria that cause infections are <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The bacteria commonly known as Staph are spherical in shape, reside on the human skin; especially in the nose, mouth, genitals and anal areas, and enter the body through cuts. While their presence in your body may not necessarily lead to a disease, in case there is any damage to the skin or any form of injury, then the body becomes less resilient and prone to infection.</p> <p>While almost everyone can be prone to infection by Staph, there are some people who are more at risk of contracting an infection. These include women who are nursing, newborns, diabetics, cancer patients, people suffering from vascular or lung diseases, people who have skin disorders, drug users, patients with intravenous catheters, surgical depressions, or those with weak immune systems.</p> <h2>Symptoms of Staphylococcus Infection</h2> <p>The early signs of infection by Staph depend, to a large extent, on the area affected. Given below are list of the most common signs and symptoms that you would observe in patient suffering from staph infection.</p> <p><ul>n<li>One of the most common symptoms is the formation of an abscess, boil, or furuncle filled with pus.</li>n<li>It is possible that the affected area may get swollen, appear red, and also cause pain to the patient.</li>n<li>If this infection has resulted in bacteremia or sepsis, then the patient may experience fever and cold and may also be diagnosed with low blood pressure.</li>n<li>In case of infected catheters or other implants, there will be tenderness, redness, and occurrence of drainage or pus.</li>n<li>In some cases, the patient may experience feeling of faintness, headache, body ache, difficulty in breathing, and diarrhea.</li>n</ul></p> <p>These are just some of the most common symptoms of infection by the Staphylococcus bacteria. Depending on the infection and the illness contracted, these symptoms could vary greatly.</p> <h2>Diseases and Conditions Caused by Staphylococcus Infection</h2> <p>Once infected by the Staph bacteria, one of the most common type of disease contracted is skin infection. This can lead to other disorders like <i>impetigo, cellulitis</i>, or even <i>scalded skin syndrome</i>. In women who are nursing, infection by Staph can result in <i>swelling up of the breasts</i> or even abscesses that can cause the bacteria to infect mother's milk. If the bacteria infects the blood stream, then it can cause disorders like <i>bacteremia</i> or <i>sepsis</i>.</p> <p>A common way in which the infection manifests itself in people with pre-existing lung diseases is <i>staphylococcal pneumonia</i>. If the heart valves are infected, then there are chances of <i>heart failure</i>. A possible result of infection by Staph is <i>osteomyelitis</i> in which the bones swell up. If the bacteria is growing in a condition in which there is little oxygen, then there may be secretion of toxins which may result in a condition known as the <i>Toxic shock syndrome</i>. It is commonly observed in women who are menstruating and using tampons.</p> <h2>Treatment of Staphylococcus Infection</h2> <p>A very commonly asked question regarding Staph infections are, what is the cure for Staphylococcus infection? To a large extent, the treatment for Staph will depend upon the type of infection that the patient suffers from. Antibiotics are commonly used for treatment. Skin infections of the minor kind are treated using ointments which need not necessarily be prescribed. Oral antibiotics are given in some cases. In case, the patient displays the presence of abscesses, then it may be essential that they be drained with the help of a surgical procedure.</p> <p>Surgery may also be an unavoidable option in case the source of the infection needs to be extracted from the body. Antibiotics may be prescribed intravenously in case of more serious conditions. The type of antibiotic prescribed depends greatly on test results to identify which strain of the Staphylococcus bacteria is causing the infection. There are some strains of Staphylococcus that are resistant to a majority of antibiotics. One such strain is the MRSA strain. In case of infection by MRSA, a combination of antibiotics may be used for treatment.</p> <p>The prognosis for infection by Staph depends largely on the seriousness of the underlying medical condition, the type of infection, and also how much the infection has spread. In case of infection of Staph, there is always a chance that the infection may return. Infection by Staphylococcus bacteria is extremely contagious and therefore, it is important to minimize chances of transmission. If you are taking care of someone who is suffering from an infection, ensure proper hygiene. In case of an infection like Staph, it is always important that you prevent the spread of the infection as far as possible.</p> <p><i><b>Disclaimer:</b> This article is for informational purposes only and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Bubonic plague is a bacterial infection, which can cause the death of millions of people in a very short span of time. One of the most devastating bacterial infection epidemics was the &quot;Black Death&quot;.</p> <p>For thousands of years, bacterial infection of various types has killed millions of people, and it is still one of the biggest medical problems faced by humans. Bubonic Plague is one of the deadliest bacterial infections that can cause death of millions of people. It is caused by the gram-negative bacillus called <i>Yersinia pestis</i>. This bacterium is responsible for bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague (the intensity and dreadful nature of the illness differs in these three illnesses).</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>As mentioned before, bacterial infection is the only cause of this disease. It is more important to know how it spreads all over. It infects animals as well as humans. Flies and airborne insects are the main cause of the spread of this disease. Flies live on dead and infected animals, such as squirrels, stray dogs, goats, rabbits, hares, coyotes, rodents, marmots, and rats. When these flies bite humans, they pass on the plague.</p> <p>The other ways this disease spreads to animals or humans is through direct contact to any infected animal and through animal bites. It may also take the form of airborne disease (pneumonic plague), which makes it even deadlier than its other forms. As compared to its other forms (pneumonic and septicemic), this condition is less lethal, and does not spread from one person to other unless it converts into other type.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Symptoms start showing up after the incubation period of about 3 to 7 days. They include:n<ul>n<li>Very high fever with severe headache</li>n<li>Malaise</li>n<li>Tachycardia</li>n<li>Regional large lymph nodes (buboes) that are tender in touch and hot to feel are developed on the patient's body (specifically near the inguinal area, groin, axilla, and the area near the neck)</li>n<li>Inflammation of the area surrounding the buboes</li>n<li>Development of purpuric eruption</li>n<li>Medical complications, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and blood poisoning</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>Symptoms such as high fever, development of buboes in inguinal area, severe headache, etc., are very helpful in preliminary diagnostic tests. Wright's or Wayson's Stain test also helps in diagnosis. It produces a safety-pin also known as bipolar effect, in the bacteria causing the disease. Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA), Giesma Stain and Gram Stain tests are two more tests which are used for diagnosing the infection. Gram Stain test is considered to be one of the most reliable tests.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>It is very important to start the treatment of this disease as soon as the symptoms are diagnosed and the disease is confirmed.<br /><br /><span>Once diagnosed, the doctor may choose the treatment based upon the patient's medical history and severity of the disease. In ancient times, when use of antibiotics was not known, the plague was cured by burning the buboes with a blood-hot iron rod, which was a barbaric method, but did save many lives.</span></p> <p>In modern times, use of antibiotics has taken place of burning the buboes. Antibiotics are used to fight the bacteria, and rest of the treatment is carried out based on the symptoms. Vaccines are also available, and should be taken at least a week in advance in case of a sudden outbreak of plague, or if the person is supposed to travel to the plague-affected area.</p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p><span>Animals and fleas play an important part in the spread of the disease. It is very important to control the population and infestation of animals, such as rats, rodents, squirrels, etc. People should keep a close watch on any unnatural behavior such as illness and deaths of animals as well as humans, in the area where the outbreak is possible. Keep the surrounding area clean. Insecticides should be used in places, which are breeding grounds for fleas.</span></p> <p><span>If any animal or human being is suspected to be suffering from plague, that animal or person should be separated from the others until the treatment is completed. Clothes used by the infected person should be kept in closed bags, and should be washed in hot water.</span></p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Fifth Disease (Erythema Infectiosum) is a common infection in children, and one among the five skin-related diseases that infect children.</p> <p>Erythema Infectiosum, also known as Fifth Disease, is caused by the human <i>Parvovirus - B19 (PV-B19)</i>, which is an erythrovirus. This disease is common in children between the ages 4 to 16. The distinctive nature of this syndrome shows up in the form of red rashes on the patient's cheeks, and appears as if the patient has been slapped or hit on the face. This disease spreads across the other parts of the body, like legs, trunk, arms, etc. The infection in children is very self-limiting, and the patient starts recovering after some time without development of more complications.</p> <p>This disease is referred as Fifth Disease, as it is the fifth number disease recognized in a group of diseases, which causes rashes in children.</p> <h3>Susceptibility</h3> <p>The ratio of males and females getting infected with this disease is almost same. It is prevalent in children, but it does not cause much harm to them, as the patient recovers in a very short period without developing more complications.</p> <p>This disease in adults (especially those who have damaged immune system and pregnant women) may get much more complicated than in children, and the result may vary depending on the extent of complications.</p> <p>(<b>Please Note</b>: This disease causing the virus <i>Parvovirus</i> is different than the <i>Parvovirus</i> found in animals, and it does not convert/transform to the human form of virus and vice versa.)</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>The patient is considered infectious during the incubation period of this disease, which involves its initiation and development, after which the symptoms starts showing up till the time when the disease matures in the patient. This disease is considered to be transmitted mainly through the body fluids from the infected patient. The body fluid is also considered to be transmitted when the patient coughs or sneezes, and an un-infected person comes in vicinity enough for him/her to get infected.</p> <p>It is also transmitted through blood transfusion or through blood products. It also spreads from an infected mother to her fetus.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p><ul>n<li>The patient may experience headache, mild fever, pharyngitis, malaise, etc., in the initial phase.</li>n<li>Some patients may also experience problems, such as diarrhea, nausea, pain in the abdominal area, arthralgias, etc.</li>n<li>In the first stage of the disease, the skin of the patient begins to appear reddish (cheeks, arms, legs, etc.), and gives an impression of being slapped. The erythematic marks appear abruptly on the skin, and they start fading in about 4 to 5 days.</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li>In the next stage, an erythematous eruption starts occurring on the patient's skin, targeting the exterior surfaces (this stage lasts for about 4 to 6 days). This pattern slowly converts into a reticulated pattern of patches/blotches on the skin of the patient, which may last from 3 to about 22 days.</li>n<li>As compared to children, if an adult is exposed to the virus<span>\u00a0</span><i>Parvovirus-B19</i>, the disease shows different characteristics and slightly different symptoms. The most common symptom experienced by an adult suffering from this disease involves symmetric joint pain, which increases over a period.</li>n<li>Patients may also experience reddening of eyes, swelling of glands, problems related to throat such as sore throat and joint pain, etc.</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Complications Involved</h3> <p>The disease in adults may get more complicated over a period as compared to children. People with a weakened immune system and with a background of shortened life span of red blood cells are prone to conditions, such as prolonged viremia leading to damaged bone marrow cells and other complications. PV-B19 virus may also trigger or cause diseases, like papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome, systemic sclerosis, acute vasculitic syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis, hemocytophagia, systemic lupus erythematosus, myocarditis, hepatitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, anemia, pulmonary diseases, erythematos exanthema (atypical), ileitis, neurological problems, nephrotic syndrome, thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, Pyruvate Kinase deficiency, etc.</p> <p>Infection in pregnant women may lead to a direct, cyto-toxic effect on the fetal red blood cells, and other problems such as congestive heart failure, anemia, hydrops fetalis, miscarriage, etc. Anemia and other complications may also be passed to the fetus.</p> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> <p>The reddish rashes on patient's body and skin can help doctors in diagnosing the disease. Other than the physical examination of the patient, the doctor also may opt for a few tests such as blood test, IgM assays, which involve immunoassyas and radioimmunoassay, Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification test, Dot-Blot Hybridization, Polymerase Chain-Reaction, etc.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Treatment varies, based on various parameters such as the age group to which the patient belongs, patient's immune system, etc. Doctors may also prescribe medicines or lotions, based on the stage of the disease.</p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p>As the initial symptoms take some time to show up, and this period falls under the period in which this disease can spread from the infected person to a healthy person (also known as the period between infection and incubation), it is very hard to baseline the preventive measures against this disease. However, children should be advised to maintain hygiene, and not use each other's used tissues or handkerchiefs. They should also be careful while interacting with sick children.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>MRSA is a type of bacterial infection that infects various human body parts. The infection is characterized by boils, abscesses, or pimples on the skin.</p> <p><i>Methicillin - Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus</i>, also known as MRSA, is a bacterium that causes infection in various parts of the body. It is considered to be one of the toughest bacteria strain to kill. It is difficult to kill because of the bacterium, which has developed resistance to most of the antibiotics used in such type of infections.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p><span>We carry numerous bacteria of various types on and in our body (for example, nose, hands, on the skin surrounding genital organs, etc.). While some of them are useful for our body; some are harmful, and the rest are neutral.\u00a0</span><i>Staphylococcus</i><span>\u00a0bacterium is commonly found on our body, and it does not harm us until it finds an entry inside our body through any laceration, wound, or any other type of opening on our skin.</span></p> <p>Once this happens, it can infect any internal body part and create a problem for us. Almost 20-25% of humans carry this bacterium on their body, and stand a strong chance of getting infected by it through some laceration, wound, or any such skin related problem. The other most common way through which it gets transmitted is through contact.</p> <p>If a healthy person comes in a physical contact with an infected person, there are strong chances of him/her getting infected with MRSA. It may also happen if he/she touches anything that has bacteria on its surface. People who have weakened or damaged immune system are also prone to this type of infection. It can even be acquired if a person is hospitalized, and there is less hygiene maintained in hospital.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p><span>As this infection can occur on any part of the body, the symptoms can vary depending on the part that is infected.</span>n<ul>n<li>Pimples, boils, or abscess erupt on the skin if the infection has occurred near the skin surface.</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li>In case of deeper wounds, complexity increases many folds, and the bacterium may infect age-old wounds (such as old injury or surgical wounds etc.), lungs, blood vessels, and also urinary system.</li>n<li>The infected part becomes reddish and swollen, containing pus accompanied with pain that gives a needle-pricking sensation.</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li>If treated in its earlier stage, this condition can be controlled very easily; but if the treatment is delayed, or the infection is routed deeper, it can become serious and deadlier.

Even though the bacteria has developed resistance to most of the antibiotics, there are still many other effective antibiotics available. Your doctor may choose a course based on various observations such as, your body response to antibiotics, need of other supplementary medicines, etc. He may also choose to avoid the use of antibiotics, and use other options, such as incision of the boil/abscess/pimple in order to remove as much of infected fluid from your body as possible.</p> <h3>Precautions</h3> <p><ul>n<li>The only precaution you are required to take is, to complete the course of medicine you have been prescribed by your doctor.</li>n<li>As already mentioned, this strain of the bacterium has become resistant to most of the antibiotics, because of the fact that people do not complete the medicine course. This helps some of the bacteria survive the antibiotics, and they learn how to resist them. Consequently, they will fight back the next time you take the medicine.</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li>As the infection occurs through the openings in the skin, you should be careful about your wounds, cuts etc. You should be careful enough to cover the cuts/wounds with proper medicated bandage. Maintain necessary hygiene, and do not touch anything that may have bacteria on its surface. Similarly, avoid touching other people's wounds or cuts.</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li>Hospitals should be carefully maintained, and use of hygienic objects should be made compulsory in such places. Along with it, people should be careful about possible infections.</li>n<li>If you are diagnosed with this disease, you should be careful not to come in physical contact with any healthy person, as it might infect him/her too.</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li>It's also important that you should complete the medical course prescribed so that the bacteria is removed completely from your body.</li>n<li>Wash your hands well with soap or sanitizer every time you touch something that is not hygienic, or may have bacteria on its surface.

Around 100,000 people are diagnosed with the same every year worldwide. This article provides some information about this condition, its symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and treatment.</p> <p>Peritonsillar abscess is a common deep infection of the head and neck caused by the combination of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritonsillar space of the head and neck regions. Although it is not confirmed how this infection starts and how it spreads, there are a couple of theories which explains the possible conditions in which a person may get infected. It is believed to start from the region between palatine tonsil and its capsules at the superior pole end. The first theory about the initiation of the infection is believed to be because of acute tonsillitis whereas few believe that the pus formation and necrosis of the capsules leads to the infection.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>The affected people may experience the following symptoms:<br>1) Sore throat, fever, and chills accompanied by timely neck pain sessions<br>2) The affected person may experience sudden change in his/her voice<br>3) Dysphagia<br>4) Malaise<br>5) Odynophagia<br>6) The affected person may also may experience dehydration<br>7) Difficulty in swallowing anything, opening mouth, any type of secretion, and drooling.<br>8) Tonsillar hypertrophy (asymmetric)<br>9) Tonsils may get displaced from their normal position<br>10) Complexities related to tonsils may erupt in the affected person, for example exudates on the tonsil and erythema of tonsils, etc.</p> <h3>Who is at the Risk of Developing PTA?</h3> <p>As mentioned earlier, the infection ratio in male and female is almost the same. People affected by the infections of peritonsillar area are prone to PTA. Also, those whose immune system is weak or damaged are more prone to this condition.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>As already mentioned above, aerobic (mainly Streptococcus species) and anaerobic (mainly Peptostreptococcus and Prevotella species) bacteria play an important role in this infection. It is said to develop due to the complications in tonsillitis and formation of pus around the tonsils (known as peritonsillar area).</p> <h3>Diagnosis and Treatment</h3> <p>If a person is suspected to have developed this condition, the doctor may prefer to carry out some tests in order to confirm the same. Further, the doctor may perform some tests like monospot test (also known as heterophile antibody test), fluid culture aspiration, radiography, CT scan, ultrasonography, etc.</p> <p>Once the affected person is diagnosed, the doctor may start the treatment to first of all give relief to him/her (such as clearing the affected person's airways) so that it can be extended further to remove the abscess. Due to the involvement of complications such as dehydration, fever, etc., it becomes important to treat the affected person for such problems (for example fluid resuscitation for dehydration and treatment for fever).</p> <p>The doctor may recommend antibiotics in order to avoid further complications and spread of the pus. Drainage (one of the two most commonly used techniques to cure PTA) of the abscess is also very important; the doctor may use the latest available technique in order to get rid of pus. The other most commonly used technique is incision, but care should be taken in order to avoid complications associated with it. The affected person might also be given steroids or pain-killers to minimize the pain.</p> <p>Based on the affected person's condition and other options, doctor may choose tonsillectomy, which has proved to be a subject of argument among many specialists due to issues such bleeding, cost, etc., associated with it.</p> <h3>Complications</h3> <p>If this condition is not taken care of properly or if the treatment is delayed, it may lead to medical complications such as:<br>1) The infection might reoccur in the affected person later in life.<br>2) The infection may lead to necrotizing infection of soft tissues in and around the neck area.<br>3) He/she may develop aspirations which may later lead to pneumonitis or pneumonia.<br>4) He/she may also develop medical complications such as mediastinitis, meningitis, jugular vein thrombosis, necrosis or rupture of carotid artery, and sepsis, etc.</p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p>As the actual cause of this infection has not yet been confirmed, there is no proven preventive measure available for this infection. However, it's important to keep in mind the following points in order to keep a distance from the possibility of this infection.</p> <p>If one is experiencing the problem of developing tonsillitis frequently or having frequent throat infections of any type, then one should be careful about getting themselves checked for the possible infection of PTA. Furthermore, one should try to avoid eating food that can facilitate pus formation in the internal organs. Also, one should avoid smoking as it causes many complications along with being injurious to health.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

Here is a brief overview of cerebral hemorrhage; its causes, symptoms, and treatment.</p> <p>The term hemorrhage is defined as escape of blood from a ruptured vessel; it can be either external or internal. Brain hemorrhage refers to such bleeding that occurs in and around the brain, within the cranium. So brain hemorrhages are also called intracranial hemorrhages, which is classified into two types - intra-axial and extra-axial. While intra-axial hemorrhages occur within the brain tissues, extra-axial hemorrhage occurs within the cranium, but outside the brain tissues. </p> <p>Intracranial hemorrhages are divided into four types - epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, and intracerebral hemorrhage. While the first three types comprise extra-axial hemorrhages; intracerebral or cerebral hemorrhage is an intra-axial hemorrhage that occurs within the brain tissues. In subdural hemorrhage, bleeding happens between the dura matter and the brain. Bleeding between the dura matter and the skull amounts to epidural hemorrhage; whereas bleeding that happens in the subarachnoid space (located between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain) is subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p> <p><div><strong>What is Cerebral Hemorrhage?</strong></div>n<br>So, intra-axial hemorrhage happens within the brain tissues; and cerebral or intracerebral hemorrhage is an intra-axial hemorrhage. Cerebral hemorrhage can be of two types - intraparenchymal and intraventricular. As the names suggest, bleeding happens in the parenchyma, and the ventricular system respectively. While the brain parenchyma consists of neurons and glial cells, the ventricular system comprise interconnected cavities that are filled with cerebrospinal fluid. It is in these cavities that the fluid is produced.</p> <p>Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is a serious medical condition that may lead to major disabilities, coma, and even death. Hypertension is the main cause for this condition. It can also be caused by physical trauma. Intraventricular hemorrhage is mainly caused by stroke or physical trauma. This type of cerebral hemorrhage is common in newborns, especially premature babies and those with a low birth weight. Mostly, such hemorrhage occurs within the first three days after birth.</p> <p><div><strong>Causes</strong></div>n<ul>n<li>Penetrating Head injury: This is the most common cause of cerebral hemorrhage in kids and adults below the age of 50.</li>n<li>Hypertension: If hypertension is not properly controlled for a long period of time, blood vessel walls may weaken and rupture, resulting in cerebral hemorrhage.</li>n<li>Aneurysm: This is a condition in which a blood vessel swells, as its wall weakens. The blood vessel may burst and cause bleeding in the brain.</li>n<li>Arteriovenous malformation: This is an abnormal congenital condition in which blood vessels are swollen and tangled, and the arteries flow into the veins. These malformations may bleed and compress brain tissues.</li>n<li>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: The condition denotes angiopathy caused by amyloid (an insoluble fibrous protein) deposits on the walls of blood vessels in the central nervous system. This is mostly found in elderly people.</li>n</ul>nThese are some of the most common causes for cerebral hemorrhage. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (blood clot in the dural venous sinuses) is an uncommon cause. Other reasons include primary or metastatic brain tumor, excessive anticoagulation, moyamoya disease, etc.</p> <p><div><strong>Symptoms</strong></div>n<ul>n<li>Loss of consciousness</li>n<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>n<li>Sudden headache</li>n<li>Delirium</li>n<li>Sudden and progressive neurologic losses like numbness, inability to move (paralysis), loss of speech or vision, confusion, etc.</li>n<li>Seizures (uncontrolled physical movements)</li>n<li>Noisy Breathing</li>n<li>Weakness in limbs</li>n</ul>nComputed tomography angiography (CTA) scan, angiogram, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan are the most common diagnostic tests that are used for determining the source, location, and severity of bleeding.</p> <p><div><strong>Treatment</strong></div>n<br>The abnormality that caused the bleeding, the location of the bleeding, and the size of the blood clot, are some of the factors that play a major role in deciding the course of treatment. Medications are used for lowering blood pressure, for arresting bleeding and clot formation, for reducing intracranial pressure, etc. Diagnostic radiology comprises different types of scans to detect the nature and location of the hemorrhage. Interventional radiology comprises minimally invasive, image-guided procedures that are often used for treating cerebral hemorrhage, without surgery. Some of these procedures involve use of focused radiation to amend irregular blood vessels that have been bleeding. Microsurgical techniques are employed to treat abnormal or leaky vessels.</p> <p>In short, cerebral hemorrhage is a serious medical condition that has to be treated at the earliest, so as to avoid debilitating and life-threatening complications. As hypertension is considered as a major cause of such hemorrhage, the condition has to be controlled with proper diet, lifestyle, and medications. Avoid smoking and use of drugs like cocaine. </p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This article is for informational purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>There are many types of brain tumors, which range from benign to malignant, and primary or secondary. The following article provides information about the various types of brain tumor.</p> <p>The brain is the most complex part of the body. It is the seat of our intelligence. It is where all our thoughts, imagination, and dreams originate from. It is what gives us the power to plan, reason, communicate, and feel. It controls our heartbeat, breathing, temperature, blood pressure, and all other vital functions. In fact, it controls and coordinates all our physical and mental faculties. All these are accomplished by this organ which makes up just about 2% of the human body's total mass.</p> <p>Since it is such a vital organ, when something goes wrong with it, it can have devastating effects on us. One of the things that may affect the brain is a brain tumor. Here is an account of the various types of brain tumors. </p> <p>The brain can be affected by tumors that may be benign or malignant, and primary or secondary. Gliomas are the most common types of primary tumors which start in the glial cells of the brain. The various types of gliomas are brain stem glioma and astrocytoma. The other types of tumors of the brain that don't originate in the glial cells are meningioma, medulloblastoma, schwannoma, and germ cell tumor. </p> <h2>Benign and Malignant Brain Tumors</h2> <p>Tumors can either be benign, which means non-cancerous, or malignant, which means cancerous.</p> <h3>Benign Brain Tumors</h3> <p><ul>n<li>There are no cancer cells in benign tumors.</li>n<li>They can be removed, and once removed, they rarely grow back.</li>n<li>The tissues around benign tumors are not invaded by the cells of the tumor.</li>n<li>The cells from this tumors do not spread to any other part of the body.</li>n<li>They can grow and put pressure on the sensitive parts of the brain, resulting in serious problems. Therefore, they can be life-threatening.</li>n<li>Although rare, benign tumors may sometimes become malignant.</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Malignant Brain Tumors</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Malignant brain tumors have cancerous cells in them.</li>n<li>Being more serious, malignant tumors can be life-threatening.</li>n<li>Malignant tumors usually grow very swiftly and invade or crowd the surrounding brain tissues.</li>n<li>Although it occurs rarely, but cancer cells can sometimes break off from a cancerous brain tumor and spread to various parts of the brain, or to the spinal cord, and sometimes to the other parts of the body too. When cancer spreads, it is known as metastasis.</li>n</ul></p> <h2>Primary and Secondary Brain Tumors</h2> <p>Primary tumors are those that originate in the tissue of the brain. They are named according to the part of the brain or the type of cells where they originate. On the other hand, the secondary tumors originate in some other part of the body. Cancer which spreads to the brain from some other part of the body is quite different from a cancer that originates in the brain. The cancers that spread to the brain from other parts of the body, such as the breast or lung, are also known as metastatic tumor. Secondary tumors are far more common than tumors that originate in the brain.</p> <p>Gliomas, which originate in glial cells, are the most common. The term \"brain cancer\" usually refers to a glioma. Gliomas are of many types, such as:n<ul>n<li>Brain Stem Glioma</li>n<li>Astrocytoma</li>n<li>Oligodendroglioma</li>n<li>Ependymoma</li>n<li>Mixed Glioma</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Brain Stem Glioma</h3> <p>This type of brain tumor occurs in the brain stem, or the lowest portion of the brain. Usually middle-aged people and young children are affected by this condition. It is usually high-grade, or that which spreads widely all over the brain stem. It is difficult to treat this type of brain tumor successfully. Usually a biopsy is not performed to diagnose this condition.</p> <h3>Astrocytoma</h3> <p>This type of tumor arises from astrocytes, which are glial cells that are star shaped. Usually, astrocytomas affect the cerebrum in adults. Children, however, tend to get it in the cerebrum, cerebellum, or the brain stem. A grade III astrocytoma is also referred to as an anaplastic astrocytoma, while a grade IV astrocytoma is also known as a glioblastoma multiforme.</p> <h3>Oligodendroglioma</h3> <p>This is a rare type of brain tumor which arises from the cells that form the fatty tissue that cover nerves in order to protect them. The cerebrum is usually where this type of brain tumor develops. This tumor grows slowly and generally does not spread to the surrounding tissues. Middle-aged people usually develop this tumor.</p> <h3>Ependymoma</h3> <p>Ependymoma brain tumors generally begin in the cells which line the spaces inside the brain and also that occur around the spinal cord. These are the spaces which contain the cerebrospinal fluid. This is a liquid that protects the brain and spinal cord by cushioning them. Usually young adults and children develop this type of brain tumor.</p> <h3>Mixed Glioma</h3> <p>These brain tumors have more than one kind of cell. The prognosis is dependent on the type of cell along with the highest grade that is present in the tumor.</p> <p>There are other types of brain tumors which do not originate in the glial cells, such as:n<ul>n<li>Meningioma</li>n<li>Medulloblastoma</li>n<li>Craniopharyngioma</li>n<li>Schwannoma</li>n<li>Germ Cell Tumor of the Brain</li>n<li>Pineal Region Tumor</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Meningioma</h3> <p>This tumor occurs in the meninges, which is a membrane that covers the brain and is located directly beneath the skull. This tumor is generally benign, with a slow growth, and usually affects women in the 30-50 age range.</p> <h3>Medulloblastoma</h3> <p>Also known as a primitive neuroectodermal tumor, this usually develops in the cerebellum and is formed from abnormal cells that occur very early in life. This is the most common type of brain tumor that affects children. Moreover, it can spread to the spine via the cerebrospinal fluid.</p> <h3>Craniopharyngioma</h3> <p>This type of brain tumor grows near the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. Although this tumor does not spread, its growth can hamper important parts of the brain, leading to serious problems. This condition is more common in children.</p> <h3>Schwannoma</h3> <p>Schwannomas develop from Schwann cells, which line the nerve located in the inner ear, which is responsible for controlling hearing and balance. Also known as an acoustic neuroma, this tumor usually affects adults.</p> <h3>Germ Cell Tumor of the Brain</h3> <p>These tumors develop from germ cells, which are reproductive cells that occur in the eggs of the ovaries or sperm in the testicles. These cells can spread to other parts of the body, forming tumors. The germinoma is the germ cell tumor that occurs most commonly in the brain, usually developing near the pineal gland, located at the center of the brain. Germ cell tumors can spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord, and children are usually affected by it.</p> <h3>Pineal Region Tumor</h3> <p>These tumors either develop inside or near the pineal gland, which is a tiny organ that lies between the cerebrum and cerebellum. It produces melatonin, which is a hormone associated with our waking and sleeping cycle. Pineal tumors are of several types, but they rarely occur.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Know the different symptoms of juvenile diabetes and what they imply. While there is no cure for this condition as yet, there are some ways by which you can manage it.</p> <p>Diabetes is a chronic metabolic state, wherein the body is unable to break down glucose (sugar) and store it properly. This, in turn, results in the glucose remaining in the person's bloodstream, and eventually leading to several complications. Basically, there are two types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes (also called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes) and Type 2 diabetes.</p> <h3>Type 1 Diabetes (a.k.a. Juvenile Diabetes)</h3> <p>Type 1 Diabetes is also referred to as juvenile diabetes as it is usually diagnosed in children. It's an auto-immune disorder, wherein the person's own body attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The resultant deficiency of insulin secretion in the pancreas leads to high blood glucose level. As the pancreas produce less or no insulin, or the cells do not respond normally to the insulin, the quantity of sugar in the blood increases. This then becomes part of the urine and is output from the body in an unused condition. If such a condition lasts for a long period, then major complications regarding kidneys, heart, eyes, and nerves may develop.</p> <h3>Symptoms to Look Out For</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Hunger: As glucose does not reach the body cells, the body is not fed. So, there is a constant feeling of hunger.</li>n<li>Frequent urination: As the level of glucose in the blood rises, the kidneys try to filter out the extraneous sugar in the blood, and therefore, the person has a constant urge to pass urine.</li>n<li>Thirst: Increase in urination, means that water is getting depleted from the body. So, the person feels thirsty.</li>n<li>Weight loss: As the body's requirement of glucose are not fulfilled, it eventually results in weight loss.</li>n<li>Fatigue</li>n<li>Flu-like symptoms</li>n<li>Fruity breath odor</li>n<li>Bedwetting</li>n<li>Confusion</li>n<li>Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet</li>n<li>Heavy or labored breathing</li>n<li>Drowsiness or lethargy</li>n</ul></p> <h3>How to Manage Juvenile Diabetes?</h3> <p><strong>Insulin:</strong> Insulin is either injected using a syringe or an infusion pump. You can't take it orally, as it will be destroyed in the stomach. The preparation of insulin that is chosen will determine how long it will take to show its effect or how long it will last. At times, more than one type of insulin will be mixed to form a dose, so as to have the best control of blood glucose. Insulin injections will be administered 1 to 4 times a day. If your child is suffering from juvenile diabetes, the health care provider or diabetes nurse educator will teach you how to give insulin injections to the child.</p> <p><strong>Diet:</strong> In order to ensure that the blood glucose level is regulated, you will have to plan your meals in such a way that there is consistency between the food and insulin. If there is an imbalance between the two, it will result in extreme variations in blood glucose levels. The American Diabetes Association and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics provides healthy and balanced meals for people with diabetes. You can also consult a registered dietitian or nutrition counselor for the same.</p> <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> This is of prime importance as it doesn't just control the amount of sugar in the blood, but also burns excess calories and fat, thus, helping a person achieve ideal weight. However, medical approval must be procured before starting an exercise program. The doctor might recommend some precautionary measures that you will have to take before, during, and after physical exercise.</p> <p><strong>Self-monitoring:</strong> It can be done by checking the glucose content of a tiny drop of blood. You will be able to analyze how insulin injections, diet, and physical exercise are working. If required, you will be able to alter these three to obtain the desired level. Additionally, it also helps in keeping a watch on how the condition is progressing.</p> <p>It may so happen that due to insulin injections, diet, and physical exercise the person may develop hypoglycemia, i.e., the blood sugar levels may become very low. This will cause sweating, weakness, nervousness, and hunger. When any of these symptoms show up, you will have to test the blood sugar levels using a test kit. If found low, you can consume juice, a cup of skimmed milk, or regular soda and the blood sugar level will be back to the normal.</p> <div class=\"buzzle-masonry-3\"> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/self-improvement/self-improvement/1200-155310603-white-man-meditating.jpg\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/self-improvement/self-improvement/1280-174228569-young-woman-doing-step-aerobics.jpg\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/misc/yoga/1280-17400801.jpg\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/misc/yoga/1280-41727464.jpg\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/misc/yoga/1280-66345565.jpg\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bz-card-image\"> <a class=\"bz-enlarge remote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pixfeeds.com/images/misc/yoga/1280-72464085.jpg\"></a> </div></div>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Night leg cramps are very painful and sudden contraction of muscles. They usually occur in the calf muscle and may last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The following article provides information about the various causes and treatment options available for this condition.</p> <p>A leg cramp is a sudden and uncontrolled contraction of a muscle in the leg. It happens when a muscle contracts too hard. The muscles that contract in this manner are those that cross two joints, such as the calf muscles (the muscles that cross the ankle and knee), the hamstring muscles (the muscles that cross the hip and knee), and the quadriceps (the muscles that also cross the knee and hip).</p> <p>Leg cramps usually occur at night, and in most cases last for a few minutes or a few seconds. They may cause tenderness of muscles, which may last for up to 24 hours. They are more common among older people. But, they may affect younger adults and children. About 1 in 3 people over the age of 60, have regular cramps. Moreover, they may occur everyday in some people.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p><span>The cramps are harmless and are mostly linked to muscle fatigue and nerve disorders. However, their occurrence increases with age. The exact cause of a leg cramp is unknown; however, there is a theory which states that a cramp occurs when a muscle that is already in a shortened position is stimulated to contract further.</span></p> <p>Apart from this, the other known causes are:n<ul>n<li>Dehydration</li>n<li>Diabetes</li>n<li>Muscle fatigue</li>n<li>Pregnancy</li>n<li>Lead poisoning</li>n<li>Excess intake of alcohol</li>n<li>Medications</li>n<li>Decrease in the potassium levels</li>n<li>Neuromuscular disorders</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Most of the cramps can be relieved by massaging the affected muscles. They ease off on their own and no painkillers are required. They can be treated by the following options:n<ul>n<li>Take a hot water bath to relax the affected muscle.</li>n<li>Walk on the affected leg, this will help exercise the calf muscles and prevent cramps.</li>n<li>Massage the affected leg, as it will provide instant relief.</li>n<li>Stretch and flex the leg up towards the head.</li>n<li>Apply a cold pack on the affected area.</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Prevention</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Drink plenty of fluids during the day, as dehydration is linked to leg cramps. Intake of fluids before, during, and after exercising is also important.</li>n<li>Stretching can help relax the muscle fibers. Also, it is important not to exercise vigorously before bedtime.</li>n</ul></p> <p><ul>n<li>Increase the intensity of exercise gradually. Increase it by only 10% compared to the previous week, as sudden changes can cause cramps in the leg.</li>n<li>Improve the posture while resting in bed. Use a pillow to elevate the leg while sleeping on your back. While sleeping on your chest, hang your feet over the end of the bed.</li>n</ul></p> <h3>When to see a doctor</h3> <p>If the leg cramps are persistent and painful, it is advisable to see a doctor. Also, in case muscle atrophy and weakness develops, consult a doctor immediately. The doctor may analyze blood samples to ensure that the levels of potassium and other electrolytes are normal. Medications to relax the muscles may also be prescribed in some cases.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

These symptoms differ as per the location of the cancerous tumors in the brain.</p> <p>Brain cancer is also called Glioma or Meningioma. If cancer starts in the brain itself, it is called primary brain cancer. If it starts elsewhere in the body and then moves to the brain, it is called metastatic brain cancer. Primary brain cancer usually is confined to the central nervous system. Death takes place due to uncontrolled tumor growth in the limited space of the skull. Metastatic brain cancer is an advanced disease, and is related to poor prognosis.</p> <p>Primary brain tumors may be cancerous or noncancerous. All the cancerous ones are malignant, and threaten life due to the aggressive and invasive nature. In the United States, 15-20 out of 100,000 are brain cancer cases. It is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in patients younger than 35. In case of children, primary brain cancer occurs in 3 out of 100,000 annually. Secondary brain cancer occurs in 20-30% patients with metastatic diseases. This incidence increases with age. Every year, about 100,000 cases of secondary brain cancer are diagnosed.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3> <p><span>In general, there are about 24 distinct symptoms of brain cancer.</span>n<ul>n<li>Vision problems</li>n<li>Vomiting</li>n<li>Nausea</li>n<li>Seizures</li>n<li>Headaches</li>n<li>Behavioral problems</li>n<li>Brain swelling</li>n<li>Hydrocephalus</li>n<li>Dizziness</li>n<li>Hearing problems</li>n<li>Motor problems</li>n<li>Memory loss</li>n<li>Memory problems</li>n<li>Cognitive problems</li>n<li>Personality changes</li>n<li>Lack of coordination</li>n<li>Stumbling</li>n<li>One-sided body weakness</li>n<li>Numbness of arms and legs</li>n<li>Weakness of arms and legs</li>n<li>Hallucinations</li>n<li>Speech problems</li>n<li>Balance problems</li>n<li>Gait problems</li>n</ul></p> <p><span>Metastatic brain cancer invades the brain tissue indiscriminately, leading to the following symptoms:</span>n<ul>n<li>Vomiting</li>n<li>Swelling</li>n<li>Seizures</li>n<li>Nausea</li>n<li>Motor dysfunction</li>n<li>Impaired mental function</li>n<li>Headache</li>n<li>Bleeding</li>n</ul></p> <h3>Symptoms of Possibly Cancerous Brain Tumor</h3> <p><span>Some brain tumors are cancerous.

    "post_name": "stomachulcers",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>If you have a persistent pain in your tummy, especially after a meal, it could be the symptoms of a stomach ulcer. Read more about its causes and treatment.</p> <p>It has been discovered by an international team of scientists that the bacteria responsible for the most painful type of stomach ulcers, the <i>helicobacter pylori</i>, has been present in the digestive system of human beings since man first migrated from Africa, more than 60,000 years ago. Do you wake up in the middle of the night because of a gnawing burning sensation in your abdominal region? Or do you get it a few hours after a meal? Do you have to take antacids to relieve the pain? Do you also have nausea, weight loss, vomiting, appetite loss, tarry black stools, or are vomiting blood? If the answers to these questions are in the affirmative, then you need to go to your doctor promptly, for, the chances are high that you have a stomach ulcer.</p> <h3>The Basics</h3> <p>Sores that form in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum are referred to as ulcers. Those that occur in the stomach are known as gastric ulcers, while the ones that erupt in the duodenum are known as duodenal ulcers. A more generalized term is peptic ulcer, which includes both the above. Stomach polyps can sometimes be malignant.</p> <p>In the US, stomach ulcers affect about 4 million people each year. According to estimates, about 20 million Americans get at least one stomach ulcer in their lifetime, of which at least 40,000 undergo surgery. And ulcer-related complications kill about 6,000 of them.</p> <p>The problem is that often when people first experience the symptoms of a stomach ulcer, they mistake them for other conditions such as indigestion, acid reflux, or hunger pangs. This is why many people delay going to the doctor until the matter becomes serious.</p> <h3>Causes</h3> <p>Stomach ulcers are caused when a part of the stomach's lining, which is made up of layers of mucous, is destroyed. These layers of mucous are what protect the stomach from digesting itself by the digestive acids it produces to break down food. Medical practitioners agree that hydrochloric acid, one of the digestive acids produced in the stomach, is generally responsible for actually destroying the damaged protective lining of the stomach.</p> <p>So, the question then arises, what is it that causes the actual breakdown of the mucous lining? The most common culprit for causing this damage of the stomach's lining is the stomach getting infected by the aforementioned bacterium, the <i>helicobacter pylori</i>, also referred to as H.pylori, which is spread via contaminated water or food. While most people who are afflicted with ulcers are found to have the H.pylori living in their gastrointestinal tract, it has also been seen that many people have this organism in their GI tract without developing ulcers.</p> <p>Hence, it is suspected that there could be many other reasons, apart from the H.pylori, for stomach ulcers developing, such as the stomach secreting more hydrochloric acid than can be handled by the lining, family or genetic predisposition, using anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin excessively, and psychological stress. Additionally, a number of other factors are also thought to contribute to the development of ulcers, like aging, smoking, poor diet and obesity.</p> <p>The best way of determining whether you have a stomach ulcer, and what may be causing it, is to consult your doctor. Your doctor, after conducting an examination and confirming it, will decide on an appropriate course of treatment.</p> <h3>Treatment</h3> <p>Two different methods are used generally to treat stomach ulcers: medication, along with surgery, and lifestyle changes. The most common medications used are H2 Blockers, mucosal protective agents, and proton pumps. These are designed to either minimize the discomfort or effects of the stomach ulcer, or cure it.</p> <p><strong>H2 Blockers:</strong> These reduce the secretion of acids by the stomach. H2 blockers taken before going to bed can cure gastric ulcers in two months or so and duodenal ulcers in about a month. H2 blockers include <i>Cimetidine, Nizatidine, Ranitidine</i>, and <i>Famotidine</i>.</p> <p><strong>Mucosal Protective Agents:</strong> As is implied by the name, these agents protect the stomach's mucous lining. These medications do not need a prescription and are available over the counter, such as <i>Rolaids</i>, otherwise known as Tums, and <i>sucralfate</i>, which forms a protective layer on the area where the ulcer is, in order to allow it to heal.</p> <p><strong>Proton Pump Inhibitors:</strong> These are also used to inhibit the production of acids by the stomach. They include <i>Esomeprazole, Omeprazole, Pantoprazole</i>, and <i>Lansoprazole</i>.</p> <p><i>Antibiotics</i> will be prescribed if H.pylori is detected as the cause of the stomach ulcer.</p> <p><i>Surgery</i> may be resorted to if the ulcers do not respond to the medications. Antrectomy, vagotomy, and pyloroplasty are the most common surgeries that are used to treat stomach ulcers.</p> <p>Since smoking, stress, poor diet, obesity, and excessive use of anti-inflammatory drugs are also thought to be contributory factors, making lifestyle changes will also be usually advised.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Want to know more about Gingivitis? Read on for information about this gum disease...</p> <h3>What is Gingivitis?</h3> <p>Gingivitis is a gum disease that is caused by bacterial plaque that accumulates in the spaces between the gums and the teeth and also in the tartar that forms on the teeth.</p> <p>If left untreated, this can lead to the formation of deep pockets between the teeth and the gums and to the loss of the bone around the teeth. This bone holds the teeth in place in your jaws, so the loss of this bone can cause your teeth to loosen and fall out.</p> <h3>How does Gingivitis occur?</h3> <p>This disease occurs if the teeth are not cleaned properly by brushing and flossing them on a regular basis. Sometimes, the disease can also progress due to heavy brushing which causes injury to the gums. Misaligned teeth, ill fitting or unclean dentures, rough edges of tooth fillings, bridges and crowns - all increase the risk of gingivitis.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of Gingivitis?</h3> <p>The most common symptoms of this gum disease include swollen gums, mouth sores, bleeding gums, itching gums, gums that feel no pain unless pressure is applied, bright red or purple gums, shiny gums and receding gum line.</p> <h3>Prevention, Cure and Treatment of Gingivitis</h3> <p>Daily brushing and flossing can reduce the chances of getting gingivitis. You should also have a dental hygienist or a dentist have a look at your teeth regularly and get your teeth cleaned from them every 6 months, if they so recommend.</p> <p>There are several treatments for gingivitis along with oral hygiene. One can gargle with Brine water or with an anti-bacterial mouthwash. Gargling with a salt water solution also helps. Another simple home remedy is to rub clove oil into the gums or chewing on a piece of clove. Use toothpaste that contains sage or peppermint oil. Those suffering from gingivitis should eat food that contains low saturated fats.</p>"

    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>Read on to find out more about the symptoms, causes, and treatment for Hyperkalemia or High Potassium Disorder...</p> <p>Hyperkalemia happens when there is an abnormally high level of potassium in the blood. When there are low potassium levels in the blood, it is called Hypokalemia. Severe hyperkalemia can cause the muscular and electrical impulses from around the heart to stop functioning causing your heart to suddenly stop beating. On the other hand, a normal high potassium disorder can cause the rhythm of the heart to become irregular. Sometimes this disorder can interfere with the workings of the muscles and can be the cause of paralysis. The sources for potassium or high potassium foods are tomatoes, potatoes, oranges, bananas and meat.<br><br><b>Symptoms</b><br><br>Hyperkalemia often does not have any particular symptoms. Some patients, however, may feel nausea, tiredness, weakness of muscles, or tingling sensations. Slow heartbeat and a weak pulse are also useful symptoms.<br><br><b>Causes</b><br><br>One of the major causes of hyperkalemia is kidney dysfunction. This is because the potassium in the body is excreted via the kidneys. So any disorder of the kidneys will often result in high potassium levels in the body, leading to this disorder.<br><br>Sometimes potassium supplements or medications like anti-inflammatory drugs can also cause Hyperkalemia.<br><br>The Adrenal glands are located next to the kidneys and they produce hormones. One of these hormones is called Aldosterone. This hormone causes the kidneys to retain the sodium and excrete the potassium via the urine. So a disease with the Adrenal gland can also lead to this disorder.<br><br>Diabetes is also known to lead to hyperkalemia, as diabetics often need Insulin to maintain their glucose levels. When there is a lack of insulin in the body, the fat cells in the body begin to breakdown. This causes the fluid and potassium in these cells to move out into the bloodstream.<br><br><b>Treatment</b><br><br>The treatment depends upon the cause of the disease. Any or all of these various treatments may be used:n<ul>n<li>A low potassium diet which controls the level of potassium in food.</li>n<li>Discontinuing the medicines that cause high levels of potassium in the blood.</li>n<li>Administering diuretics which cause the potassium in the blood to be excreted via urine.</li>n<li>Administration of calcium intravenously to protect the heart and the muscles from the effects of hyperkalemia.</li>n<li>If all measures fail and renal failure has also occurred, then Dialysis may be carried out.</li>n</ul>nPotassium is very important for the smooth functioning of the muscles, heart and the nerves. It is important for controlling the activity of the various muscles of the body, including the muscles of the heart. It also helps transmit the electrical impulses through the body's nervous system. Hence, it is extremely important to keep the potassium levels in your body normal.</p>"

    "post_name": "root-canal-treatment",
    "post_content": "<div class=\"bz-card-image\"></div> <p>A root canal procedure is used to restore teeth. Read more about the treatment in this article.</p> <p>Root canal treatment, also known as <i>endodontics</i>, is usually done to save a tooth when the nerve and blood vessels in the center of the tooth, which form the dental pulp, die, resulting in the tooth becoming infected. The infection is generally caused when the tooth decays, either because of a fracture of the tooth, or sepsis under the filling. A broken or loose filling may also result in the tooth pulp getting infected.</p> <p>If left untreated, the infection can cause an abscess in the tooth, resulting in swelling, pain, and even the jawbone getting infected. Apart from root canal, the only other alternative is to extract the affected tooth. Even though many people often prefer getting their infected tooth extracted, most dental experts recommend keeping as many natural teeth as possible. Root canal treatment does just that, its aim being to avoid removing teeth whenever possible. Prior to the procedure, antibiotics are usually given to deal with any infection both inside the tooth, as well as the surrounding tissues, such as the bone.</p> <p>When the tooth's pulp is dead or is in the process of dying, and the chamber of the pulp gets infected, the natural defenses of the body are unable to combat the infection because there is no circulation left in the tooth.</p> <p><b>Procedure</b>n<ol>n<li><b>Examination and Anesthetization</b>: The dentist usually starts by using a low current to check if the tooth is dead. If the patient feels nothing, it implies that the nerve is no longer alive, and that the procedure can be carried out without using anesthesia. If it is found that the nerve is still alive, a local anesthesia will be applied on the tooth along with the surrounding area.</li>n<li><b>Drilling into the Tooth</b>: Then, the dentist will use a drill in order to access the pulp to be able to remove the inflamed or dead tissue. If it is a front tooth that is being worked upon, it will be drilled from behind, and if it is a molar, the drilling will be done from the top of the tooth.</li>n<li><b>Removing the Insides</b>: Different sizes of rasps are used to remove the tissue from inside the tooth. The process can be quite time-consuming because the root of a tooth often has several thin extensions and smaller branches. During the procedure, the cavity will be cleansed occasionally to clear out the loosened material. Once the cavity is cleared, the tooth will be disinfected so that there is no recurrence of the inflammation.</li>n<li><b>The Filling</b>: Next, a rubbery paste is used to fill the cavity, and then the drilled hole is sealed. Gutta-percha, which is a whitish rubber obtained from coagulating the milky latex from trees of the same name, is the rubber that is used for the filling. This rubber comes in sticks of various thickness and length. The sticks are heated, which causes them to amalgamate and fill the cavity in the tooth.</li>n</ol>n<b>Recovery</b></p> <p>The treatment could involve several visits, hence, while it is ongoing, it is advisable not to chew or bite down, especially on foods that are hard or tough. Your restored tooth will be free of pain once the treatment is completed, although it may feel a little sensitive for a number of days. Over-the-counter painkillers like <i>Ibuprofen</i> or <i>Paracetamol</i> can be used to lessen the discomfort. However, if the swelling or pain lasts longer than it should, you should consult your dentist. Most people are under the misapprehension that this treatment method is painful. However, this perception is due to the past operations, when they were actually painful. But these days, they are no longer painful due to newer anesthetics and technologies.</p> <p>The teeth, which have had their roots filled, are usually more brittle than the live ones. In order to protect the remains of the structure of the tooth, dentists sometimes suggest putting a crown on the tooth. As long as oral hygiene is maintained, and you consult your dentist immediately if there is any pain, a restored crown or tooth usually lasts for many years without requiring any further treatment, often even lasting a lifetime.</p> <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: <i>This HealthHearty article is for informative purposes only, and should not be used as a replacement for expert medical advice.</i></p>"
