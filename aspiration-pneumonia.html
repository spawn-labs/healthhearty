      </h1>
      <div class="post-content">
         <p>Aspiration pneumonia is also known as anaerobic pneumonia, aspiration of vomitus and necrotizing pneumonia. It is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes and lungs that is caused by inhaling foreign material.</p> <p>Inhaling foreign material into the lungs may lead to an inflammatory reaction, an infection or a collection of pus in the lungs. Aspiration of foreign material into the lungs may occur with disorders that affect the esophagus or normal swallowing. Another cause is a decreased or absent gag reflex in people who are conscious or semi-conscious.</p> <p>Aspiration pneumonia usually affects older people and those who are debilitated, intoxicated by drugs or alcohol, unconscious from anesthesia or a medical condition. A healthy person, who inhales a large amount of material, can also develop this condition.</p> <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3> <p><ul>n<li>Pain in the chest</li>n<li>Exhaustion</li>n<li>Fever</li>n<li>Rapid heart rate</li>n<li>Discoloration of the skin</li>n<li>Shortness of breath</li>n<li>Cough</li>n</ul>nOther symptoms like excessive sweating, difficulty while swallowing and breath odor, may also be associated with aspiration pneumonia.
