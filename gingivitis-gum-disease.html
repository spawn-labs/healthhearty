         <p>Want to know more about Gingivitis? Read on for information about this gum disease...</p> <h3>What is Gingivitis?</h3> <p>Gingivitis is a gum disease that is caused by bacterial plaque that accumulates in the spaces between the gums and the teeth and also in the tartar that forms on the teeth.</p> <p>If left untreated, this can lead to the formation of deep pockets between the teeth and the gums and to the loss of the bone around the teeth. This bone holds the teeth in place in your jaws, so the loss of this bone can cause your teeth to loosen and fall out.</p> <h3>How does Gingivitis occur?</h3> <p>This disease occurs if the teeth are not cleaned properly by brushing and flossing them on a regular basis. Sometimes, the disease can also progress due to heavy brushing which causes injury to the gums. Misaligned teeth, ill fitting or unclean dentures, rough edges of tooth fillings, bridges and crowns - all increase the risk of gingivitis.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of Gingivitis?</h3> <p>The most common symptoms of this gum disease include swollen gums, mouth sores, bleeding gums, itching gums, gums that feel no pain unless pressure is applied, bright red or purple gums, shiny gums and receding gum line.</p> <h3>Prevention, Cure and Treatment of Gingivitis</h3> <p>Daily brushing and flossing can reduce the chances of getting gingivitis. You should also have a dental hygienist or a dentist have a look at your teeth regularly and get your teeth cleaned from them every 6 months, if they so recommend.</p> <p>There are several treatments for gingivitis along with oral hygiene. One can gargle with Brine water or with an anti-bacterial mouthwash. Gargling with a salt water solution also helps. Another simple home remedy is to rub clove oil into the gums or chewing on a piece of clove. Use toothpaste that contains sage or peppermint oil. Those suffering from gingivitis should eat food that contains low saturated fats.</p>
